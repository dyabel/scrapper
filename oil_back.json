His analysis covers the Nelson\u2013Plosser macroeconomic data series as well as a postwar quarterly real gross national product (GNP) series. His tests reject the unit-root null hypothesis for most of the series. This article takes issue with the assumption used by Perron that the Great Crash and the oil-price shock can be treated as exogenous events. A variation of Perron's test is considered in which the breakpoint is estimated rather than fixed. We argue that this test is more appropriate than Perron's because it circumvents the problem of data-mining. The asymptotic distribution of the estimated breakpoint test statistic is determined. The data series considered by Perron are reanalyzed using the test static. The empirical results make use of the asymptotics developed for the test statistic as well as extensive finite-sample corrections obtained by simulation. The effect on the empirical results of fat-tailed and temporally dependant innovations is investigated. In brief, by treating the breakpoint as endogenous, we find that there is less evidence against the unit-root hypothesis than Perron finds for many of the data series but stronger evidence against if for several of the series, including the Nelson\u2013Plosser industrial-production, nominal-GNP, and real-GNP series.\nCollapse", "4": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) creates fear and uncertainty, hitting the global economy and amplifying the financial markets volatility.

This crisis has been one of the defining economic events of the 1970s and has shaped how many economists think about oil price shocks. In recent years, a large literature on the economic determinants of oil price fluctuations has emerged. Drawing on this literature, we first provide an overview of the causes of all major oil price fluctuations between 1973 and 2014. We then discuss why oil price fluctuations remain difficult to predict, despite economists\u2019 improved understanding of oil markets. Unexpected oil price fluctuations are commonly referred to as oil price shocks. We document that, in practice, consumers, policymakers, financial market participants and economists may have different oil price expectations, and that, what may be surprising to some, need not be equally surprising to others.\nCollapse", "16": "In a simplified theoretical framework we model the strategic interactions between OPEC and non-OPEC producers and the implications for the global oil market. Depending on market conditions, OPEC may find it optimal to act either as a monopolist on the residual demand curve, to move supply in-tandem with non-OPEC, or to offset changes in non-OPEC supply. We evaluate the implications of the model through a Structural Vector Auto Regression (VAR) that separates non-OPEC and OPEC production and allows OPEC to respond to supply increases in non-OPEC countries. This is done by either increasing production (Market Share Targeting) or by reducing it (Price Targeting). We find that Price Targeting shocks absorb half of the fluctuations in oil prices, which have left unexplained by a simpler model (where strategic interactions are not taken into account). Price Targeting shocks, ignored by previous studies, explain around 10 percent of oil price fluctuations and are particularly relevant in the commodity price boom of the 2000s. We confirm that the fall in oil prices at the end of 2014 was triggered by an attempt of OPEC to re-gain market shares. We also find the OPEC elasticity of supply three times as high as that of non-OPEC producers.

Three different oil price data were applied in this study; the specific spot oil price of individual countries, the OPEC reference basket oil price and an average of the Brent, WTI and Dubai oil price. The dynamic panels ARDL were used to estimate the short and the long-run impacts. Also, this study partitioned the oil price into positive and negative changes to capture asymmetric impacts and found both positive and negative oil price changes positively influenced inflation. However, the impact was found to be more significant when oil prices dropped. The results from the study also found that money supply, the exchange rate and GDP are positively related to inflation while food production is negatively related to inflation. Accordingly, policymakers should be cautious in formulating policies between the positive and negative changes in oil prices as it was shown that inflation increased when the oil price dropped. Additionally, the use of contractionary monetary policy would help to reduce the inflation rate, and lastly, it is proposed that the government should encourage domestic food production both in quantity and quality to reduce inflation.\nCollapse", "20": "The paper proposes a machine-learning approach to predict oil price.

Accurate forecasting of the crude oil price and realization of the forecasts based on this forecast will provide savings or gains in government and corporate economies, which can reach billions of dollars. There is a great need for this estimation in countries where crude oil production is low and heavily dependent on crude oil import.

Most of these researchers\u2019 studies, however, do not separate out the sources of oil price shocks when examining the asymmetric effects. In this article, we address this limitation using a two-stage Markov regime-switching approach. Our results indicate that oil supply and demand shocks have a null or minimal impact on stock returns in a low-volatility regime and a statistically significant impact in a high-volatility regime. We observe that oil demand shocks affect stock returns significantly more than oil supply shocks. A positive aggregate demand shock significantly increases stock returns, whereas a positive oil-specific demand shock markedly decreases stock returns. These results have important implications for policymakers and investors.\nCollapse", "23": "Since the oil price shocks of the 1970s, several studies have found significant impacts of oil prices on macro variables. However, it is particularly crucial to know how each micro sector in an economy, such as the residential, transport, industrial and non-energy sectors, respond to oil price impulses. In this research, we try to shed light on the impact of crude oil price volatility on each sector in Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest crude oil consumer. In order to do so, we apply a vector auto regression model and perform impulse response analysis by using quarterly data from Q1 1990 to Q1 2014. The findings indicate that some economic sectors, such as the residential sector, did not have significant sensitivity to the sharp oil price fluctuations. In contrast, some other sectors, like the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors, were strongly sensitive to the drastic oil price fluctuations. Moreover, our findings show that after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which led to the shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan, because of greater reliance on oil imports, the sensitivity of most sectors to oil price volatility declined.\nCollapse", "24": "We study the impact of oil price shocks on the U.S. stock market volatility.

This implies that innovations to the price of crude oil are not strictly exogenous, but predetermined with respect to the stock market.

Regimes of low and high uncertainty are identified in a threshold VAR model in which the effects of structural oil demand and supply shocks are estimated. The results show that higher macroeconomic uncertainty, as measured by global industrial production volatility, significantly increases the sensitivity of oil prices to shocks in oil demand and supply. This occurs as uncertainty lowers the price elasticity of oil demand and supply. The difference in the estimated oil price elasticities is economically meaningful as the price impact of a similar change in oil production might double when it hits the economy in uncertain times.

As the empirical and theoretical models used by economists have evolved, so has our understanding of the determinants of oil price shocks and of the interaction between oil markets and the global economy. Some of the key insights are that the real price of oil is endogenous with respect to economic fundamentals and that oil price shocks do not occur ceteris paribus. As a result, one must explicitly account for the demand and supply shocks underlying oil price shocks when studying their transmission to the domestic economy. Disentangling cause and effect in the relationship between oil prices and the economy requires structural models of the global economy including the oil market.\nCollapse", "40": "This study provides analytical insight on modelling macroeconomic and oil price volatility in Nigeria. Mainly, the paper employed GARCH model and its variants (GARCH-M, EGARCH and TGARCH) with daily, monthly and quarterly data.

By implication, the Nigerian economy is vulnerable to both internal shocks (interest rate volatility, real GDP volatility) and external shocks (exchange rate volatility and oil price volatility). Therefore, it is concluded that more credence should be given to asymmetric models in dealing with macroeconomic volatility in Nigeria and oil price volatility should be considered as relevant variable in the analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations in Nigeria. The study recommends that, the Nigerian economy should be diversified by revamping other sectors such as the agricultural sector and the industrial sector in order to reduce the impact of oil price uncertainty on macroeconomic volatility.\nCollapse", "41": "This paper assesses the impact of crude oil price movements on two macro variables, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate and consumer price index inflation rate, in the developed economies of the United States and Japan, and an emerging economy, the People's Republic of China (PRC).

The main objective of this study is to see whether these economies are still reactive to oil price movements. The results obtained suggest that the impact of oil price fluctuations on developed oil importers\u2019 GDP growth is much lower than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. The main reasons for this lie in fuel substitution (higher use of nuclear energy, gas, and renewables), a declining population (for Japan), the shale gas revolution (for the United States), and strategic oil stocks and government-mandated energy efficiency targets in developed economies. All of these factors make developed economies more resistant to oil shocks. On the other hand, the impact of oil price movements on the PRC's inflation rate was found to be milder than in the two developed countries that were examined. The main cause for this is that the PRC experiences a larger forward shift in its aggregate supply due to higher growth, which allows it to avoid a massive increase in price levels following oil price shocks.\nCollapse", "42": "This paper investigates the effect of oil price uncertainty on global real economic activity using a quarterly vector autoregressive model with stochastic volatility in mean. Stochastic volatility allows oil price uncertainty to vary separately from changes in the level of oil prices, and allows one to incorporate an extraneous indicator of oil price uncertainty such as realized volatility that greatly improves the precision of the estimated uncertainty series.

Instead, asymmetries are more likely driven by the effect of oil price innovations on expected and/or realized demand. We inquire whether the size of the shock matters in that doubling the size of the shock more (or less) than doubles the size of the response, finding that the effect of a 2.s.d innovation is just about double the magnitude of the impact of a 1.s.d innovation.

First, we show that the cross-equation restrictions of a SVAR impose a nonlinear relation between the short-run price elasticities of oil supply and oil demand. This relation implies that seemingly plausible restrictions on oil supply elasticity may map into implausible values of the oil demand elasticity, and vice versa. Second, we propose an identification scheme that restricts these elasticities by minimizing the distance between the elasticities allowed by the SVAR and target values that we construct from a survey of relevant studies. Third, we use the identified SVAR to analyze sources and consequences of movements in oil prices. We find that (1) oil supply shocks and global demand shocks explain 50 and 35 percent of oil price fluctuations, respectively; (2) a drop in oil prices driven by supply shocks boosts economic activity in advanced economies, whereas it depresses economic activity in emerging economies; and (3) the selection of oil market elasticities is essential for understanding the source of oil price movements and to measuring the multipliers of oil prices on economic activity.\nCollapse", "50": "In this paper we provide novel evidence on changes in the relationship between the real price of oil and real exports in the euro area.

We find that from the 1980s onwards the relationship between oil prices and euro area exports has become less negative conditional on oil supply shortfalls and more positive conditional on foreign productivity shocks. Using the theoretical model we show that our empirical findings can be accounted for by (i) stronger trade relationship between the euro area and emerging economies (ii) a decrease in the share of oil in production and (iii) increased competitive pressures in the product market.\nCollapse", "51": "Many empirical studies on the oil price shock effects on the economies of oil-exporting countries have assumed a linear relationship between the shocks and macroeconomic variables, offering no insights on the dynamics of different types of shocks. The literature also assumes a homogeneous response to oil price shocks by oil-exporting countries. This paper investigates the non-linear effects of oil price shock on macroeconomic performance in the context of two groups of oil-exporting countries using a VAR model with price shocks estimated by a GARCH method. The model consists of oil price shocks and economic growth as two major variables of interest as well as intermediate variables such as investment, exchange rate, and inflation rate. The sample includes nine major oil-exporting countries, six developing and three developed countries, for the period 1970\u20132010. The results indicate that not all oil-exporting countries are alike in responding to oil shocks. While oil shocks have asymmetric effects in oil-exporting developing countries; lower oil prices lead to major revenue cuts and ensuing stagnation in the economy, but higher oil prices and accompanying higher revenues do not translate into sustained economic growth; they do not have significant effect on economic growth in oil-exporting developed countries. The panel data estimation results also suggest that heterogeneous responses to oil price shocks in oil-exporting countries can be explained by differences in their institutional quality, particularly government effectiveness.\nCollapse", "52": "This paper formally tests for non-linearity in the relationship between real oil prices and real stock returns for Canada, Germany, the UK, and the US, and also assesses whether there are significant differences in the impact of oil price shocks on the stock markets studied. The findings provide evidence of non-linearity when windows with a fixed number of observations are considered. The non-linear specification that seems to do the best job of summarizing such non-linearity is the scaled specification, which considers not just whether oil prices increase or decline (and by how much) but also the environment in which the movements take place, highlighting more specifically the importance of controlling for the time-varying conditional variability of oil price shocks. An oil shock in a stable price environment is likely to have larger consequences on stock returns than one in a volatile price environment. Moreover, we find negative responses of real stock returns to oil price shocks for all countries. These responses are generally statistically similar between the North American countries considered, and between the European countries studied, although statistically different between the two groups of countries.\nCollapse", "53": "We propose an enhanced regime-switching model to investigate the relationships between oil price surges and stock market cycles in five oil-dependent countries. Our model accounts for the joint effects of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent oil markets and simultaneously captures asymmetry, volatility persistence and regime shifts contained in the underlying financial data. We find that stock market returns strongly exhibit a regime-switching behaviour, but they react differently to the increases in the price of oil. More precisely, the conditional volatility of studied stock markets during the bear market phases is found to be less affected by oil price surges than during the bull market phases. Whether the effects of oil shocks are positive or negative depends greatly on the degree of reliance on imported oil, the share of the cost of oil in the national income and the degree of improvement in energy efficiency of a given country. Finally, the relatively opposite effects of the WTI and Brent oil markets suggest the potential of substitution between them as well as the necessity of a diversification strategy of oil supply sources.\nCollapse", "54": "This article investigates the relationship between real crude oil price changes and the Chinese real stock market at the industry level.

We separately analyze three key stages of oil production: drilling wells, completing wells, and production from completed wells. We find that the important margin is drilling investment. We estimate drilling responses of approximately 1.6 percent for tight oil and 1.2 percent for conventional oil per 1 percent change in oil prices. In addition, tight oil wells produce about 4.6 times more oil compared to conventional ones. Together, the long-run price responsiveness of supply is about 6 times larger for tight oil on a per well basis, and about 9 times larger when also accounting for the rise in unconventional-directed drilling. Based on our estimates derived from microdata, we conduct aggregate simulations of incremental oil supply at different time frames and price levels. The simulations show that the U.S. supply response is much larger now due to the shale revolution. Given a price rise to $80 per barrel, U.S. oil production could rise by 0.5 million barrels per day in 6 months, 1.2 million in 1 year, 2 million in 2 years, and 3 million in 5 years. Nonetheless, it takes many months before a substantial portion of the full supply response is online, longer than the 30 to 90 days typically associated with the role of \"swing producer\" such as Saudi Arabia.\nCollapse", "71": "This study employs the general methods of moment (GMM) to examine the impact of oil price shocks on the Nigerian economy, using data from 1981 to 2012. After appropriate robustness checks, the study finds out that oil price shocks insignificantly retards economic growth while oil price itself significantly improves it. The significant positive effect of oil price on economic growth confirms the conventional wisdom that oil price increase is beneficial to oil-exporting country like Nigeria. Shocks however create uncertainty and undermine effective fiscal management of crude oil revenue; hence the negative effect of oil price shocks.\nCollapse", "72": "Although oil price shocks have long been viewed as one of the leading candidates for explaining U.S. recessions, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which oil price shocks explain recessions. We provide the first formal analysis of this question with special attention to the possible role of net oil price increases in amplifying the transmission of oil price shocks. We quantify the conditional recessionary effect of oil price shocks in the net oil price increase model for all episodes of net oil price increases since the mid-1970s. Compared to the linear model, the cumulative effect of oil price shocks over course of the next two years is much larger in the net oil price increase model. For example, oil price shocks explain a 3% cumulative reduction in U.S. real GDP in the late 1970s and early 1980s and a 5% cumulative reduction during the financial crisis. An obvious concern is that some of these estimates are an artifact of net oil price increases being correlated with other variables that explain recessions. We show that the explanatory power of oil price shocks largely persists even after augmenting the nonlinear model with a measure of credit supply conditions, of the monetary policy stance and of consumer confidence. There is evidence, however, that the conditional fit of the net oil price increase model is worse on average than the fit of the corresponding linear model, suggesting much smaller cumulative effects of oil price shocks for these episodes of at most 1%.\nCollapse", "73": "Dependency on oil-derived fuels in various sectors, most notably in mobility, has left the global economy vulnerable to several macroeconomic economic side effects. Numerous studies have addressed the effect of price volatility on specific economic parameters. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review of the interactions between global macroeconomic performance and oil price volatility (OPV). Price volatility is intrinsic in commodity markets, but has been advancing at a faster rate in the crude oil market in comparison to other commodities over the past decade, reflecting the status of oil as the most globalised commodity. In this paper, the analytical literature review and analysis of the behavioral responses of macroeconomic agents to OPV shows that such volatility has several damaging and destabilizing macroeconomic impacts that will present a fundamental barrier to future sustainable economic growth if left unchecked. To ensure macroeconomic isolation from OPV, a combination of supply and demand-side policies have been recommended that can help to mitigate and build resilience to the economic uncertainty advanced by OPV.\nCollapse", "74": "Abstract Health expenditures as a share of GDP in the United States have more than tripled over the past half-century. A common conjecture is that this is a consequence of rising income. We investigate this hypothesis by instrumenting for local area income with time series variation in oil prices interacted with local oil reserves. This strategy enables us to capture both partial equilibrium and local general equilibrium effects of income on health expenditures. Our central income elasticity estimate is 0.7, with 1.1 as the upper end of the 95% confidence interval, which suggests that rising income is unlikely to be a major driver of the rising health expenditure share of GDP.\nCollapse", "75": "U.S. retail food price increases in recent years may seem large in nominal terms, but after adjusting for inflation have been quite modest even after the change in U.S. biofuel policies in 2006. In contrast, increases in the real prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and rice received by U.S. farmers have been more substantial and can be linked in part to increases in the real price of oil. That link, however, appears largely driven by common macroeconomic determinants of the prices of oil and agricultural commodities rather than the pass-through from higher oil prices. We show that there is no evidence that corn ethanol mandates have created a tight link between oil and agricultural markets. Rather increases in food commodity prices not associated with changes in global real activity appear to reflect a wide range of idiosyncratic shocks ranging from changes in biofuel policies to poor harvests. Increases in agricultural commodity prices in turn contribute little to U.S. retail food price increases, because of the small cost share of agricultural products in food prices. There is no evidence that oil price shocks have caused more than a negligible increase in retail food prices in recent years. Nor is there evidence for the prevailing wisdom that oil-price driven increases in the cost of food processing, packaging, transportation and distribution are responsible for higher retail food prices. Finally, there is no evidence that oil-market specific events or for that matter U.S. biofuel policies help explain the evolution of the real price of rice, which is perhaps the single most important food commodity for many developing countries.\nCollapse", "80": "Exploration of tight oil and gas formations has significantly increased US oil and gas production in recent years. However, detailed economic analysis of this production, including identification of the break-even price (BEP), the measure of price used to plan exploration and development, a synergy between price volatility and the BEP, and a feedback effect of tight oil production on oil prices, has yet to be carried out. Here we show that the BEP for rigs used to drill oil wells is $20 (~$50 nominal), the effect of price volatility on rig activity declines as the price for crude oil or natural gas moves above or below this BEP, firms use futures prices (not spot prices) to plan exploration and development, and new rig productivity affects both drilling activity and oil prices. The latter indicates that increases in new rig productivity can account for much of the 2014 oil price decline.Tight oil and gas extraction is costly and low prices lead to reduction in investments and eventually production. Here, studying the effects of price volatility on active rigs, researchers find the break-even price and show that firms use future and not spot prices to plan exploration and development investment.\nCollapse", "81": "This study examines the consequences of oil price volatility on the growth of the Nigerian economy within the period 1970 to 2010. Using quaterly data and employing the VAR methodology, the study finds that of the six variables employed, oil price volatility impacted directly on real government expenditure, real exchange rate and real import, while impacting on real GDP, real money supply and inflation through other variables, notably real government expenditure. This implies that oil price changes determines government expenditure level, which in turn determines the growth of the Nigerian economy. This result seems to reflect the dominant role of government in Nigeria. Considering the destabilizing effects of oil price fluctuations on economic activity and government spending in Nigeria, the study makes some recommendations. Some of these include; fiscal prudence, reform in budgetary operations, export diversification, revival of the non-oil sector of the economy, accountability and corporate governance.\nCollapse", "82": "The present paper analyzes the inflationary effects of oil prices at the aggregate and disaggregated levels for Thailand using symmetric and asymmetric cointegration and error-correction modeling approaches. The cointegration test results suggest the presence of long-run relations between oil prices and the following price indices: aggregate consumer price index, non-food and beverage price index, housing and furnishing price index, energy price index, non-raw food and energy price index and transportation and communication price index. Meanwhile, food and beverage price index and raw food price index are not cointegrated with the oil prices. From the dynamic analyses, we uncover evidence for asymmetric adjustments of the aggregate consumer prices, the non-food and beverage prices and the housing and furnishing prices towards their long-run values. Further, the effects of oil prices on inflation are observed to be significant in all goods sectors in the short run. The largest impacts of oil price changes are on the energy price inflation followed by the transportation and communication price inflation and the non-raw food and energy price inflation.\nCollapse", "83": "While the oil price shocks of 1970s can be explained by pure supply factors, starting in the 1980s oil prices increasingly began to come under a different type of pressure. Oil prices accelerated from about $35/barrel in 1981 to beyond $111/barrel in 2011. At the same time interest rates subsided from 16.7 per cent per annum to about 0.1. This paper explains how this long-term price increase was, in most cases, caused by expansionary monetary policies that heightened oil prices through interest rate channels. Aggressive monetary policies stimulated oil demand and blew up oil prices, a trend that led to slower economic growth. As for elasticities, the results described in this paper show that oil demand price elasticity is low value and unlike some earlier literature states, supply price elasticity is statistically significant. In last section, the results show that oil prices adjust instantly, declaring the existence of equilibrium in the oil market during the period from 1960 to 2011.\nCollapse", "84": "This paper proposes an empirical investigation of the impact of oil price forecast errors on inflation forecast errors for three different sets of recent forecast data: the median of SPF inflation forecasts for the United States and the Central Bank inflation forecasts for France and the United Kingdom.

First, there is a significant contribution of oil price forecast errors to the explanation of inflation forecast errors, whatever the country or the period considered. Second, the pass-through of oil price forecast errors to inflation forecast errors is typically multiplied by around 2 when the oil price volatility is large.\nCollapse", "85": "Crude oil price forecasting is gaining increased interest globally. This interest is due mainly to the economic value attached to the product. For this reason, new forecasting methods are proposed in the literature.

This is because many studies have previously used this same data and it will afford a common basis for assessment. To evaluate the performance of the model, the study employs two measures, RMSE and MAE. These are used to compare the performance of the proposed technique and that of ARIMA and GARCH methods for the most efficient in crude oil price forecasting. The results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the other two in terms of forecast accuracy while it achieved a forecast error of 0.8684 that of ARIMA and GARCH were 0.9856 and 1.0134 respectively judging by their RMSE.\nCollapse", "90": "This paper examines empirically whether oil price shocks impact stock market returns.

The empirical results provide evidence that crude oil supply shocks have significant effects on the contemporaneous tanker market. However, the impact of crude oil non-supply shocks is insignificant. In addition, the accumulated responses of the tanker market to crude oil non-supply shocks and crude oil supply shocks are positive but they are far lower than other shocks to the tanker market.

For the overall market index, an increase in oil price return significantly reduces return, and an increase in oil price return volatility significantly reduces volatility. An advantage of looking at sector returns rather than a general index of stock returns is that sectors may well differ markedly in how they respond to oil price shocks. The energy and material sectors (as expected) and the financial sector (surprisingly) are out of step (in different ways) with results for the other sectors and for the overall index. A rise in oil price increases returns in the energy and material sectors and an increase in oil price return volatility increases stock return volatility in the financial sector. Explanation for the negative (positive) association between oil return (oil return volatility) and returns (volatility of returns) in the financial sector must be based on the association via lending to and/or holdings of corporate bonds issued by firms with significant exposure to oil price fluctuations and their speculative positions in oil related instruments.\nCollapse", "94": "This research will focus on the relationship between strategic commodities (namely oil and gold prices) and the Islamic stock market in Malaysia.

The variables involved in this research are Crude Oil Price (COP), Kijang Gold Price (KGP), and FTSE Bursa Malaysia Emas Shariah Index (FBMES). Using data covering the period from January 2007 to December 2011, the study applies the co-integration analysis, Granger causality test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VDC) analysis. The findings show that Islamic stock returns were not co-integrated with strategic commodities in the long run. From the Granger causality viewpoint, it was observed that there was a bi-directional causality relationship between Islamic stock returns with oil prices. On the other hand, the FBMES was not affected by the gold prices or vice versa. Therefore, it can be concluded that, among strategic commodities, only oil\u2019s price variables will affect the Islamic stock return in the short run in Malaysia.

We revisit this contentious question by estimating a sign-restricted structural vector autoregression (SVAR). First, using a simple storage model, we show that revisions to expectations regarding oil market fundamentals and the effect of mispricing in oil derivative markets can be observationally equivalent in a SVAR model of the world oil market a la Kilian and Murphy (2013), since both imply a positive co-movement of oil prices and inventories. Second, we impose additional restrictions on the set of admissible models embodying the assumption that the impact from noise trading shocks in oil derivative markets is temporary.

In particular, the forecasts based on oil-sensitive stock price indices are able to outperform significantly the no-change forecasts. For example, using the NYSE Arca (AMEX) oil index as a predictor, the 1-month-ahead forecasts for nominal crude oil prices reduce the mean squared prediction error by between 22% (for the West Texas Intermediate oil price) and 28% (for the Dubai oil price). Moreover, we find that the directional forecast based on the AMEX oil index is significantly better than a 50:50 coin toss.

Oil price shocks is decomposed into oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks and oil-specific demand shocks using a structural vector auto-regression model, and their impacts on stock market prices were analysed using impulse response and variance decomposition analysis. The impulse response results show that stock market's response to oil supply shocks is insignificantly negative but significantly positive to aggregate demand and oil-specific demand shocks. The cumulative effects of the oil price shocks account for about 47 per cent of the variation in stock prices in the long term. These results suggest that the origin of oil price shocks is crucial for understanding the volatility in Nigeria's stock market.

Higher volatility in oil prices works through two main channels. On one hand, it makes the marginal product of capital riskier, creating an incentive to substitute away from capital. On the other hand, it increases the demand for precautionary savings. The latter may imply higher capital accumulation in response to a rise in oil price uncertainty depending on whether agents have access to an international bond as an alternative asset. The investment decline because of higher oil price volatility under financial integration is almost twice as much as the decline under financial autarky.

By considering the Realized Volatility of oil prices, rather than following the standard approach of considering oil price shocks in levels, the effects of factor price uncertainty on economic activity are analyzed. Sample countries represent developed and developing, oil importing and exporting and service/industry-based economies (United States, Japan, Germany, South Korea, India, and Malaysia) and thus complement the standard literature's analysis of Western OECD countries. In a vector auto-regressive setting, Granger causality tests, impulse response functions, and variance decompositions show that oil price volatility has more-adverse effects in all sample countries than oil price shocks alone can explain. The paper finds that the sensitivity to oil price volatility varies widely across countries and discusses various factors which may determine the level of sensitivity (such as sectoral composition and the energy mix). This implies that the standard approach of solely considering net oil importer-exporter status is not sufficient. Simulations of volatility shocks in hypothetical energy mixes (with increased renewable shares) illustrate the potential economic benefits resulting from efforts to disconnect the macroeconomy from volatile commodity markets. It is concluded that expanding renewable energy can in principle reduce an economy's vulnerability to oil price volatility, but a country-specific analysis would be necessary to identify concrete policy measures.

Second, conditional on an estimated interest rate policy reaction function, the paper demonstrates that no two structural shocks induce the same monetary policy response, even after controlling for the impact response of the real price of oil, and quantifies these differences. Third, the paper shows that the policy responses implied by a policy rule, whose coefficients were chosen to maximize U.S. welfare, differ substantially from the policy response implied by the same rule estimated on historical data. Among a wide range of rules, a rule that is easily implementable and that nearly maximizes U.S. welfare involves the Federal Reserve putting zero weight on the price of oil and responding to wage inflation without interest rate smoothing.\nCollapse", "113": "Understanding the Decline in the Price of Oil since June 2014 / Christiane Baumeister & Lutz Kilian.

Our earlier research found that easy monetary policy had a significant impact on energy prices during the period of 1980-2011.

This analysis examines monthly data from January 1982 to September 2010. Since 2002 the direction of the relationship in the Granger causality sense has been from the dollar exchange rate to the oil price.

We explore reasons for this evolution. We show that a likely explanation of this empirical fact is that both the short-run price elasticities of oil demand and of oil supply have declined considerably since the second half of the 1980s. This implies that small disturbances on either side of the oil market can generate large price responses without large quantity movements, which helps explain the latest run-up and subsequent collapse in the price of oil.

The paper finds that business-cycle-driven oil demand shocks are the most important drivers of U.S. oil price fluctuations during 1982\u20132007. Disregarding the storage facility in the model causes a considerable upward bias in the estimated role of oil supply shocks in driving oil price fluctuations.

The theoretical framework of this study is based on Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasity modeled by Tim Bolerslev (1986) and Exponential General Autoregressive Conditional heteroskedastic modeled by Daniel Nelson (1991). These models were used to estimate the relationship between oil price changes and exchange rate. Relevant descriptive and econometric analyses were employed. The econometric tests adopted include the unit root tests, Johansen co-integration technique and the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM); the time series property examined shows that all the variables were stationary at first difference. The long run relationship among the variables was determined using the Johansen Co-integration technique while the vector correction mechanism was used to examine the speed of adjustment of the variables from the short run dynamics to the long run. It was observed that a proportionate change in oil price leads to a more than proportionate change in exchange rate volatility in Nigeria; which implies that exchange rate is susceptible to changes in oil price. The study therefore recommend that the Nigeria government should diversify from the Oil sector to other sectors of the economy so that Crude oil will no longer be the mainstay of the economy and frequent changes in crude oil price will not influence exchange rate volatility significantly in Nigeria.\nCollapse", "131": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the oil price pass\u2010through into consumer price inflation for a developing country: Malaysia.

The objective of this research is to analyze the dynamic effects of oil price and macroeconomic variables changes on Islamic stock market in Malaysia using an estimation of Vector Auto Regression (VAR) method.

Using monthly data over the period January 2007 - December 2011, the study applies the co-integration analysis, multivariate Granger causality test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VDC) analysis. The findings showed that Islamic stock prices are co-integrated with oil price and exchange rate variables. Based on cointegration relationship analysis, the Islamic stock price is positively and significantly related to the oil price variable but inversely and not significantly related to the exchange rate variable. Using Granger causality test, only oil price variable is Granger-caused by the Islamic stock return in Malaysia.

Recently, several new methods of testing and quantifying asymmetric responses of U.S. real economic activity to positive and negative oil price innovations have been developed.

Others have suggested that a major shock to oil price expectations occurred when in late November 2014 OPEC announced that it would maintain current production levels despite the steady increase in non-OPEC oil production. Both conjectures are perfectly reasonable ex ante, yet we provide quantitative evidence that neither explanation appears supported by the data. We show that more than half of the decline in the price of oil was predictable in real time as of June 2014 and therefore must have reflected the cumulative effects of earlier oil demand and supply shocks. Among the shocks that occurred after June 2014, the most influential shock resembles a negative shock to the demand for oil associated with a weakening economy in December 2014. In contrast, there is no evidence of any large positive oil supply shocks between June and December. We conclude that the difference in the evolution of the price of oil, which declined by 44% over this period, compared with other commodity prices, which on average only declined by about 5%-15%, reflects oil-market specific developments that took place prior to June 2014.\nCollapse", "143": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) regularly publishes monthly and quarterly forecasts of the price of crude oil for horizons up to 2 years, which are widely used by practitioners. Traditionally, such out-of-sample forecasts have been largely judgmental, making them difficult to replicate and justify. An alternative is the use of real-time econometric oil price forecasting models. We investigate the merits of constructing combinations of six such models. Forecast combinations have received little attention in the oil price forecasting literature to date. We demonstrate that over the last 20 years suitably constructed real-time forecast combinations would have been systematically more accurate than the no-change forecast at horizons up to 6 quarters or 18 months. The MSPE reductions may be as high as 12% and directional accuracy as high as 72%. The gains in accuracy are robust over time. In contrast, the EIA oil price forecasts not only tend to be less accurate than no-change forecasts, but are much less accurate than our preferred forecast combination. Moreover, including EIA forecasts in the forecast combination systematically lowers the accuracy of the combination forecast. We conclude that suitably constructed forecast combinations should replace traditional judgmental forecasts of the price of oil.\nCollapse", "144": "This paper tests the three leading specifications of asymmetric and possibly nonlinear feedback from the real price of oil to U.S. industrial production and its sectoral components. We show that the evidence for such feedback is sensitive to the estimation period. Support for a nonlinear model is strongest for samples starting before 1973. Instead, using post-1973 data only, the evidence against symmetry becomes considerably weaker. For example, at the aggregate level, there is no evidence against the hypothesis of symmetric responses to oil price innovations of typical magnitude, consistent with results of Kilian and Vigfusson [Quantitative Economics, 2(3), 419\u2013453 (2011)] for U.S. real GDP. There is strong evidence of asymmetries at the disaggregate level, however, especially for industries that are energy-intensive in production (such as chemicals) or that produce goods that are energy-intensive in use (such as transportation equipment).

It makes three main arguments. First, that oil prices have never been as important as is popularly thought. Second, that the most important route through which oil prices affect output is monetary policy: when oil prices pass through to core inflation, monetary authorities raise interest rates, slowing growth. Based on the second argument, the third argument is that high oil prices have not reduced growth in recent years because they no longer pass through to core inflation, so the monetary tightening previously seen in response to high oil prices is absent. It also argues that oil prices had little impact on the global recession of 2008--9.

Majority of studies support the existence of a negative association, while some recent evidences seem to have popularised the view that outcomes are the artefacts of misspecified functional forms. This study, although similar in spirit to this popular opinion, is, however, distinct in a number of ways. Firstly, unlike most Nigeria\u2010specific studies, this paper explores alternative measures of oil price shocks, which have been developed and used in the literature with a view to ascertaining the extent to which conclusions about the oil price\u2010growth association depend on the definition of shocks adopted. More importantly, this, to the best of our knowledge, is a pioneer attempt at introducing threshold effects into the linkage between oil price shocks and output growth in Nigeria. The relatively recent regime\u2010dependent multivariate threshold autoregressive model, together with the characteristic impulse response functions and forecast error variance decomposition, is adopted in this study. Using quarterly data spanning 1985\u20132008, a non\u2010linear model of oil price shocks and economic growth is estimated. Our main results indicate that oil price shocks do not account for a significant proportion of observed movements in macroeconomic aggregates. This pattern persists despite the introduction of threshold effects. This implied the enclave nature of Nigeria's oil sector with weak linkages. Therefore, the need to spend oil revenue productively is imperative if favourable effect on real output growth is envisaged.\nCollapse", "152": "Over the past 10 years, financial firms have increased the size of their positions in the oil futures market. At the same time, oil prices have increased dramatically. The conjunction of these developments has led some observers to argue that financial speculation caused the run-up in oil prices. Yet several arguments cast doubt on the validity of this claim. First, although the stock of open futures contracts is many times larger than the flow of oil consumption in the United States, comparing these two statistics is misleading. Stocks are not measured with respect to a specific unit of time but flows are, so the two are not directly comparable. Second, empirical analysis shows that changes in financial firms\u2019 positions do not predict oil-price changes, but that oil-price changes predict changes in positions. Third, the evidence indicates that financial firms\u2019 positions did not cause the market to expect persistent price increases during 2007/08. Other explanations for the increase in oil prices include macroeconomic fundamentals, such as interest rates and increased demand from emerging Asia. Of these two explanations, the one that seems most consistent with the facts explains oil-price fluctuations in terms of large and persistent demand shocks related to growth in global real activity in the presence of supply constraints.\nCollapse", "153": "This paper aims to examine the impacts of oil-price shocks on China\u2019s price levels.

Prior to 1987, according to standard VAR models, the Federal Reserve was not responding to the inflation triggered by oil price shocks, as commonly presumed, but rather to the oil price shocks directly, consistent with a preemptive move by the Federal Reserve to counteract potential inflationary pressures. There are indications that this response is poorly identified, however, and there is no evidence that this policy response in the pre-1987 period caused substantial fluctuations in the Federal Funds rate or in real output.

Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict. We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not). We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect.

This paper analyses the dynamic relationship between oil price shocks and major macroeconomic variables in Nigeria by applying a VAR approach. The study points out the asymmetric effects of oil price shocks; for instance, positive as well as negative oil price shocks significantly increase inflation and also directly increases real national income through higher export earnings, though part of this gain is seen to be offset by losses from lower demand for exports generally due to the economic recession suffered by trading partners. The findings of the study show a strong positive relationship between positive oil price changes and real government expenditures. Unexpectedly, the result identifies a marginal impact of oil price fluctuations on industrial output growth.

Understanding what went wrong in the 1970s is the key to learning from the past. One explanation explored in Barsky and Kilian (2002) is that worldwide shifts in monetary policy regimes not related to the oil market played a major role in causing both the major oil price increases of the 1970s and stagflation in many economies. A competing view exemplified by Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1997) is that the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s arose exogenously with respect to global macroeconomic conditions, but were propagated by the reaction of monetary policy makers, causing stagflation in the process. This paper reviews the evidence for these two main explanations, interprets recent events in light of this evidence, and outlines implications for monetary policy.\nCollapse", "220": "Using the generalized dynamic factor model, this study constructs three predictors of crude oil price volatility: a fundamental (physical) predictor, a financial predictor, and a macroeconomic uncertainty predictor.

We construct GARCH\u2010MIDAS (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity\u2013mixed\u2010data sampling) models combining realized volatility with the predictors to predict oil price volatility at different forecasting horizons. We then identify the predictive power of the realized volatility and the predictors by the model confidence set (MCS) test. The findings show that, among the four indexes, the financial predictor has the most predictive power for crude oil volatility, which provides strong evidence that financialization has been the key determinant of crude oil price behavior since the 2008 global financial crisis. In addition, the fundamental predictor, followed by the financial predictor, effectively forecasts crude oil price volatility in the long\u2010run forecasting horizons. Our findings indicate that the different predictors can provide distinct predictive information at the different horizons given the specific market situation.

World oil prices skyrocketed from about $90 a barrel in January 2008 to cross the $140 a barrel mark in June, finally hitting a record high of $147 a barrel on July 11, 2008 before collapsing to less than $40 a barrel in December. Was the oil price increase of over 50 percent in the first six months of 2008 a bubble? If it was a bubble and oil prices overshot their long-term equilibrium level in the first half of 2008, did they undershoot when the bubble burst in the second half of the year? Khan looks at a variety of indicators and explanations and concludes that speculation in the oil market created an oil price bubble in the first half of 2008. Absent speculative activities, the oil price would probably have been in the $80 to $90 a barrel range. What, then, does the 2008 phenomenon imply for the future? If, as Khan argues, speculation played a significant role in the 2008 bubble, then policies--such as those being considered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission--to limit aggregate futures positions will need to be implemented soon to prevent another bubble from emerging. Another long-run danger for the world economy is that oil capacity expansion has slowed in 2009 but world oil demand is predicted to rise to 89 million barrels a day by 2014. If supply does not keep up and provide the additional barrels needed, a serious imbalance between future demand and supply in the world oil market would emerge. A major joint effort on the part of both producers and consumers to correct this potential imbalance, possibly along the lines recently proposed by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, involving both capacity expansion and conservation, will be needed over the next few years. Absent such an agreement, and if speculation is not controlled, oil prices could rise much higher than their long-term equilibrium level.\nCollapse", "222": "This paper reconsiders the macroeconomics of the oil price for Germany.

To achieve this, we develop a dynamic model with overlapping generations (called MEGIR-SA), which we believe is the first empirical application of its type to be developed for an oil-exporting country. The model is used to analyze the effects of the increase in some Saudi administered energy prices implemented at the end of December 2015. In particular, the model analyzes how these price increases might affect the welfare of Saudis through a direct increase in energy expenditures, an indirect rise in Saudi public income stemming from a lower domestic demand for oil that fosters oil exports at a given level of domestic oil production, and a direct increase of the turnover of the energy sector. The two latter effects can be redistributed by the Saudi public authorities to private agents through higher current public spending and/or public investment. The analysis suggests that the increase in end-user energy prices results in a net overall favorable effect on the intertemporal welfare of all households. This mirrors the impact on the income of private agents of the surplus in public oil income associated with lower domestic consumption of oil products and recycled to private agents. Moreover, it is shown that the additional oil income associated with the increase in domestic energy prices tends to be relatively more beneficial to future generations if it is recycled through public investment. This is reinforced if the future price of oil remains relatively low. In a possible future situation of declining oil prices and domestic production, a policy that would help meet the Saudi Arabian objectives may consist of gradually increasing the fraction of the additional oil income that is recycled through public capital spending.\nCollapse", "224": "This paper assesses, empirically, the effects of oil price shocks on the real macroeconomic activity in Nigeria using both the Granger causality tests and multivariate VAR analysis.

The non-linear estimation records significant improvement over the linear estimation and the one reported earlier by Aliyu (2009). Further, utilising the Wald and the Granger multivariate and bivariate causality tests, results from the latter indicate that linear oil price change and all the other oil price transformations are significant for the system as a whole.

The results are robust to different (linear and non-linear) transformations of oil prices. The effects on the other variables are more modest.

Nearly all of the response to a crude oil price increase shows up in the pump price within 4 weeks, while decreases are passed along gradually over 8 weeks. The asymmetry could indicate market power of some producers or distributors, or it could result from inventory adjustment costs. By analyzing price transmission at different points in the distribution chain we investigate these theories. We find that some asymmetry occurs at the level of the competitive spot market for gasoline, perhaps reflecting inventory costs. Wholesale gasoline prices, however, exhibit no asymmetry in responding to crude oil price changes, indicating that refiners who set wholesale prices are not the source of the asymmetry. The most significant asymmetry appears in the response of retail prices to wholesale price changes. We argue that this probably reflects short run market power among retail gasoline sellers.\nCollapse", "250": "This study assesses empirically the effects of oil price shocks on the real economic activity of the main industrialized countries.

The demand for biodiesel would reduce the volume of palm oil available in the market, putting upward pressure on its price and those of other vegetable oils. With this recent new demand, the palm oil price has increased sharply since July 2006, which can be taken as the date when the palm oil price began to be influenced by the traditional economic factors, such as its production, price of soyabean oil, stock-usage ratio and weather, as well as by the new demand for biodiesel. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method was used to estimate the palm oil price from July 2006 to end 2007 without the effect of biodiesel.

However, only ethanol prices adjust, in a non-linear fashion, to deviations from this long-run parity.

In all cases, market prices of ethanol can be above or below the consumer price paid for ethanol. With a tax credit, we determine several key parameters affecting the price relationships between corn, ethanol and gasoline, including the relative value of the fuel tax and tax credit, and the value of corn returned to the market in the form of by-products. The outcome is further complicated if the mandates are binding or if price contingent corn production subsidies like deficiency payments are available. Empirical analysis of historical U.S. price relationships assesses the validity of the alternative models and the extent to which each policy impacted the market. The implicit subsidy of the tax credit and mandates is often higher than the observed corn price itself. We discuss several reasons for this including how corn production subsidies cause the corn price to fall below that which would occur if there was no ethanol policy. Therefore, without corn production subsidies in the past, no ethanol production would have occurred, even with a tax credit or a mandate. Furthermore, corn producers do not benefit at all from ethanol policies when the deficiency payment program is operational and very little from the tax credit when the mandate is binding. We extend de Gorter and Just's concept of water in the tax credit to include the premium due to a binding mandate. The resulting rectangular deadweight costs are estimated for the past 25 years and are found to dwarf standard triangular deadweight cost measures of traditional farm subsidies. Those who emphasize the benefits of ethanol policy in reducing tax costs of farm programs ignore new deadweight costs created by ethanol policy including an increase in the deadweight costs of the farm subsidy program. Furthermore, farm subsidies increase both the tax costs of the tax credit and the deadweight costs due to ethanol policy.

This is especially true when we consider a sustained increase in productivity growth or a shift in production technology toward more oil-intensive goods in regions such as emerging Asia.

Following four years of relative stability at around $105 per barrel (bbl), oil prices have declined sharply since June 2014 and are expected to remain low for a considerable period of time. The drop in prices likely marks the end of the commodity supercycle that began in the early 2000s. Since the past episodes of such sharp declines coincided with substantial fluctuations in activity and inflation, the causes and consequences of and policy responses to the recent plunge in oil prices have led to intensive debates. This paper addresses four questions at the center of these debates, with particular emphasis on emerging market and developing economies: 1) How does the recent decline in oil prices compare with previous episodes? 2) What are the causes of the sharp drop and what is the outlook for oil price? 3) What are the economic and financial consequences? 4) What are the main policy implications? The decline in oil prices will lead to significant real income shifts from oil exporters to oil importers, likely resulting in a net positive effect for global activity over the medium term. However, several factors could counteract the global growth and inflation implications of the lower oil prices. These include weak global demand and limited scope for additional monetary policy easing in many countries. The disinflationary implications of falling oil prices may be muted by sharp adjustments in currencies and effects of taxes, subsidies, and regulations on prices. Regarding fiscal policy, the loss in oil revenues for exporters will strain public finances, while savings among oil importers could help rebuild fiscal space. Lower oil prices also present a window of opportunity to implement structural reforms. These include, in particular, comprehensive and lasting reforms of fuel subsidies, as well as energy taxes more broadly.\nCollapse", "270": "Do oil prices and stock markets move in tandem or in opposite directions?

The majority of papers we survey study the impacts of oil markets on stock markets, whereas, little research in the reverse direction exists. Our review finds that the causal effects between oil and stock markets depend heavily on whether research is performed using aggregate stock market indices, sectorial indices, or firm-level data and whether stock markets operate in net oil-importing or net oil-exporting countries. Additionally, conclusions vary depending on whether studies use symmetric or asymmetric changes in the price of oil, or whether they focus on unexpected changes in oil prices.

Our analysis suggests that this decline produced a cumulative stimulus of about 0.9 percent of real GDP by raising private real consumption and non-oil-related business investment, and an additional stimulus of 0.04 percent, reflecting a shrinking petroleum trade deficit. This stimulative effect, however, has been largely offset by a large reduction in real investment by the oil sector. Hence, the net stimulus since June 2014 has been close to zero. We show that the U.S. economy\u2019s response was not fundamentally different from that observed after the oil price decline of 1986. Then as now, the U.S. economy\u2019s response is consistent with standard economic models of the transmission of oil price shocks. We find no evidence that frictions in reallocating capital and labor across sectors or increased uncertainty about the price of gasoline explain the sluggish response of U.S. real GDP growth. Nor do we find evidence of financial contagion, of spillovers from oil-related investment to non-oil-related investment, of an increase in household savings, or of households deleveraging.\nCollapse", "292": "This paper surveys the literature on the relationship between oil prices and the macroeconomy in order to explain why high oil prices over the past three years do not appear to have led to a slow-down the world economy. It makes three arguments. First, that oil prices have never been as important as is popularly thought. Second, that the most important route through which oil prices affect output is monetary policy: when oil prices pass through to core inflation, monetary authorities raise interest rates, slowing growth. It is argued that the direct effect of high oil prices on output is relatively small and that the microeconomic mechanisms proposed in the literature are insufficient to explain the historical impact of oil prices. Based on the second argument, the third argument is that high oil prices have not reduced growth in the past three years because they no longer pass through to core inflation, so the monetary tightening previously seen in response to high oil prices is absent.\nCollapse", "293": "We develop a structural model of the global market for crude oil that for the first time explicitly allows for shocks to the speculative demand for oil as well as shocks to the flow demand and flow supply. The forward-looking element of the real price of oil is identified with the help of data on oil inventories. The model estimates rule out explanations of the 2003-08 oil price surge based on unexpectedly diminishing oil supplies and based on speculative trading. Instead, we find that this surge was caused by fluctuations in the flow demand for oil driven by the global business cycle. There is evidence, however, that speculative demand shifts played an important role during earlier oil price shock episodes including 1979, 1986, and 1990. Recently, it has been suggested that it is possible for speculative trading to occur even without any change in oil inventories, if the short-run price elasticity of oil demand is zero. Our structural model allows us to obtain an estimate of this elasticity based on shifts of the supply curve along the demand curve. We show that, even after accounting for the role of inventories in smoothing oil consumption, our estimate of the price elasticity of oil demand is not close to zero and much higher than traditional estimates from dynamic models that do not account for price endogeneity. This eliminates speculation as an explanation of the 2003-08 oil price surge.\nCollapse", "294": "The present paper analyses the relations between food and oil prices for Malaysia using a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) model. The bounds test of the NARDL specification suggests the presence of cointegration among the variables, which include the food price, oil price and real GDP. The estimated NARDL model affirms the presence of asymmetries in the food price behavior. Namely, in the long run, we find a significant relation between oil price increases and food price. Meanwhile, the long run relation between oil price reduction and the food price is absent. Furthermore, in the short run, only changes in the positive oil price exert significant influences on the food price inflation. With the absence of significant influence of oil price reduction on the food price both in the long run and in the short run, the role of market power in shaping the behavior of Malaysia\u2019s food price is likely to be significant.\nCollapse", "300": "The paper proposes the pricing in the oil market and the impact of oil prices on world stock indices.

The practical significance of this work lies in the structuring of existing knowledge on the applicability of the probit-models in the context of the Russian economy.

This work fills a gap in the use and implementation of the probit-models for the Russian economy. We make the forecast of supply and demand in the oil market in the next 1-3 years.

The effect of oil prices on the stock markets is generally asymmetrical, except of the Russian and Canadian stock markets, because Russian and Canadian economies depend on oil export indeed.\nCollapse", "301": "Based on a two-country, two-period general equilibrium model of the spot and futures markets for crude oil, we show that there is no theoretical support for the common view that oil futures prices are good predictors of the spot price in the mean-squared error sense; yet under certain conditions there is support for the view that oil futures prices are unbiased predictors. Our empirical analysis documents that futures-based forecasts are biased and typically inferior to simple and easy-to-use forecasting methods such as the no-change forecast. This does not mean that there is no useful information in oil futures prices. We demonstrate that fluctuations in the oil futures basis are larger and more persistent than fluctuations in the basis of foreign exchange futures. Within the context of our theoretical model, this anomaly can be explained by the marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. We show that increased uncertainty about future oil supply shortfalls causes the basis to decline and precautionary demand for crude oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price that is not necessarily associated with an accumulation of oil inventories. Our main result is that the negative of the basis may be viewed as an index of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand for oil. Our empirical analysis of this index provides independent evidence of how shifts in market expectations about future oil supply shortfalls affect the spot price of crude oil. Such expectation shifts have been difficult to quantify, yet have been shown to play an important role in explaining oil price fluctuations. Our empirical results are consistent with related evidence in the literature obtained by alternative methodologies.\nCollapse", "302": "The paper presents an empirical study of volatility spillover from oil prices to stock markets within an asymmetric BEKK model.

Within a fully optimizing framework with nominal and real rigidities arising from costly adjustment, large increases in energy prices can generate inflation persistence similar to that seen in the 1970s if the monetary authority misperceives the economyOs supply capacity and workers are able to temporarily resist some of the erosion in their real consumption wages resulting from the energy price increase. In the absence of these two responses, the model suggests that energy price shocks cannot generate the type of stagflation witnessed in the 1970s.

Oil price shocks affect the economy through the supply side (higher production costs, reallocation of resources), the demand side (income effects, uncertainties) and the terms of trade. The effects of oil price shocks have become less intense over time (thanks to technological innovation, the development of cost-effective alternative sources of energy, sectoral change and the structural change of the oil market) and are asymmetric. An increase in the price of oil feeds through to GDP growth to a much larger extent than a decline, a phenomenon that can be attributed to adjustment costs associated with sectoral reallocations, the implications of uncertainties for spending on consumer durables and investment, and nominal wage rigidities. Furthermore, the element of surprise in oil price hikes seems to play a considerable role. Thus, when a rise in the price of oil occurs after a prolonged period of oil price stability, it has a larger impact than a price hike which immediately follows previous cuts. The role of monetary policy is still a controversial issue. According to some authors, a tightening of monetary policy following an oil price shock has a much more severe impact than the direct effects of the oil price shock themselves. However, empirical evidence on this matter is ambiguous. Current simulations for the euro area, the U.S.A. and Japan show that a constant oil price rise of 10% generates negative growth effects of some 0.1% a year in the first three years \u2014 not taking into account monetary responses.

What portion of the capital gains or losses experienced by investors in regulated firms is due to regulation and what portion is due to unanticipated economic events? To answer these questions we use microeconomic theory to derive hypotheses about how the capital gains and losses created by OPEC pricing and U.S. regulatory policies are related to the underlying characteristics of petroleum firms. We test the hypotheses by including a model of firm-specific abnormal returns in the standard market models of common stock returns earned by investors in petroleum firms.

We identify six strands in the literature corresponding to different empirical methodologies and discuss to what extent each approach sheds light on the role of speculation.

The timing, the magnitude, and the sign of this measure may differ greatly from current state-of-the-art estimates. It is shown that only a small fraction of the observed oil price increases during oil crisis periods can be attributed to exogenous oil production disruptions. Exogenous oil supply shocks cause a sharp drop of U.S. real GDP growth after five quarters rather than an immediate and sustained reduction in economic growth and a spike in CPI inflation after three quarters. Overall, exogenous oil supply shocks made remarkably little difference for the evolution of the U.S. economy since the 1970s, although they did matter for some historical episodes.\nCollapse", "382": "This paper investigates the global macroeconomic consequences of falling oil prices due to the oil revolution in the United States, using a Global VAR model estimated for 38 countries/regions over the period 1979Q2 to 2011Q2. Set-identification of the U.S. oil supply shock is achieved through imposing dynamic sign restrictions on the impulse responses of the model. The results show that there are considerable heterogeneities in the responses of different countries to a U.S. supply-driven oil price shock, with real GDP increasing in both advanced and emerging market oil-importing economies, output declining in commodity exporters, inflation falling in most countries, and equity prices rising worldwide. Overall, our results suggest that following the U.S. oil revolution, with oil prices falling by 51 percent in the first year, global growth increases by 0.16 to 0.37 percentage points. This is mainly due to an increase in spending by oil importing countries, which exceeds the decline in expenditure by oil exporters.\nCollapse", "383": "Using US and global data we estimate auto-regressive models of US and global food prices as a function of oil prices, GDP per capita and biofuels production.

In sum, we demonstrate that both higher oil prices and increased biofuels production have raised food prices, and that this has contributed to global poverty and chronic undernourishment.\nCollapse", "384": "Futures markets are a potentially valuable source of information about market expectations. Exploiting this information has proved difficult in practice, because the presence of a timevarying risk premium often renders the futures price a poor measure of the market expectation of the price of the underlying asset. Even though the expectation in principle may be recovered by adjusting the futures price by the estimated risk premium, a common problem in applied work is that there are as many measures of market expectations as there are estimates of the risk premium. We propose a general solution to this problem that allows us to uniquely pin down the best possible estimate of the market expectation for any set of risk premium estimates. We illustrate this approach by solving the long-standing problem of how to recover the market expectation of the price of crude oil. We provide a new measure of oil price expectations that is considerably more accurate than the alternatives and more economically plausible. We discuss implications of our analysis for the estimation of economic models of energy-intensive durables, for the debate on speculation in oil markets, and for oil price forecasting.\nCollapse", "385": "This paper surveys the history of the oil industry with a particular focus on the events associated with significant changes in the price of oil. Although oil was used much differently and was substantially less important economically in the nineteenth century than it is today, there are interesting parallels between events in that era and more recent developments. Key post-World-War-II oil shocks reviewed include the Suez Crisis of 1956-57, the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974, the Iranian revolution of 1978-1979, the Iran-Iraq War initiated in 1980, the first Persian Gulf War in 1990-91, and the oil price spike of 2007-2008.

It has been suggested that the predictive relationship between the price of oil and one-quarter-ahead U.S. real GDP is nonlinear in that (a) oil price increases matter only to the extent that they exceed the maximum oil price in recent years, and that (b) oil price decreases do not matter at all. We examine, first, whether the evidence of in-sample predictability in support of this view extends to out-of-sample forecasts. Second, we discuss how to extend this forecasting approach to higher horizons. Third, we compare the resulting class of nonlinear models to alternative economically plausible nonlinear specifications and examine which aspect of the model is most useful for forecasting. We show that the asymmetry embodied in commonly used nonlinear transformations of the price of oil is not helpful for out-of-sample forecasting; more robust and often more accurate real GDP forecasts are obtained from symmetric nonlinear models based on the 3-year net oil price change.

In common with other episodes of retrenchment induced by rapid declines in asset values, greater leverage may have amplified the dynamics of the oil price decline. The high debt burden of the oil sector also complicates the assessment of the macroeconomic effects of the oil price decline because of its impact on capital expenditure and government budgets, and due to the interaction with a stronger dollar.\nCollapse", "391": "Purpose - \u2013 This study aims to investigate the dynamic relationships between oil price shocks and Indian stock market.

However, his study pertained to a period in which all the large oil price movements were upward, and thus it left unanswered the question whether the correlation persists in periods of price decline. Moreover, the price variable he used was somewhat distorted by price controls in the 1970s. This note investigates whether Hamilton's results continue to hold when the sample is extended to include the recent oil market collapse and the oil price variable is corrected for the effects of price controls. Particular attention is given to the possibility of asymmetric responses to oil price increases and decreases, as suggested in the structural employment literature (Loungani 1986; Davis 1987; Hamilton 1988).

As expected, we found that oil-producers (here, Iran and Russia) benefit from oil price shocks. However contrary to previous findings, they also benefit from the indirect effect through their trade partners. For oil-consuming economies, the effects are more diverse. In some countries, output falls in response to an oil price shock, while some others seem to be relatively immune. Generally, those countries which trade more with oil producers gain indirect benefits via higher demand from oil-producers. For instance, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, the US, the UK, and China get a negative direct effect and positive indirect effect from oil producing countries. This is exactly the result that we anticipated. India has both negative effects directly and indirectly and seems to suffer more in a positive oil price shock.

The shares of corn and ethanol price variability directly attributed to volatility in the crude oil market are generally between 10%- 20%, but reached nearly 45% during the financial crisis, when world demand for oil changed dramatically. Volatility transmission is also found from the corn to the ethanol market, but not the opposite.

To analyse the issue, we adopt the approach proposed by Breitung and Candelon (2006) along with the traditional VAR-based conditional Granger causality. The results of VAR-based conditional Granger causality provide evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship in both study periods. Impulse response analysis shows a positive response of the oil price to one standard deviation shock in the trade balance, whereas the trade balance shows a negative response to one standard deviation shock in the oil price. However, frequency domain analysis also provides evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship, which holds for dissimilar frequencies in the short and medium run in the full sample. Moreover, greater strength and a high degree of cyclicality are found when causality runs from the oil price to the trade balance. Interestingly, the results of the post current account convertibility era provide evidence of frequency domain causality running from the oil price to the trade balance in the short, medium and long run, not otherwise. Hence, our study shows that the oil price has become a leading indicator of the Indian trade balance for the short, medium and long horizons.\nCollapse", "397": "Building on Kilian and Park's (2009) structural VAR analysis of the effects of oil demand and supply shocks on the U.S. stock market, this paper focuses on the differences and commonalities of stock price responses in oil exporting and importing economies in 1974\u20132011. Structural oil price shocks add to our understanding of the 2008 stock market crash. I find that unexpected reductions in world oil supply do not affect stock returns in any of six OECD countries. Although an increase in global aggregate demand consistently raises oil prices and cumulative real stock returns, the effect is more persistent for oil exporters. Other, e.g., precautionary oil demand shocks have a detrimental impact on stock markets in oil-importing countries, a statistically insignificant effect for Canada, and a significantly positive effect for Norway. Oil price shocks account for a larger share of the variation in aggregate international stock returns than in national stock returns.\nCollapse", "398": "This paper uses a multiple regression model derived from an adaptation of Nerlove's partial adjustment model to estimate both the short-run and long-run elasticities of demand for crude oil in 23 countries.

In addition, previous studies have mostly neglected nonlinearities which for example may stem from exogenous oil price shocks. Using monthly data for various oil-exporting and oil-importing countries, this study contributes to the clarification of those issues. We discriminate between long-run and time-varying short-run dynamics, using a Markov-switching vector error correction model. In terms of causality, the results differ between the economies under observation but suggest that the most important causality runs from exchange rates to oil prices, with a depreciation of the dollar triggering an increase in oil prices. On the other hand, changes in nominal oil prices are responsible for ambiguous real exchange rate effects mostly through the price differential and partly also through a direct influence on the nominal exchange rate. Overall, the fact that the adjustment pattern frequently differs between regimes underlines the fact that the relationships are subject to changes over time, suggesting that nonlinearities are an important issue when analyzing oil prices and exchange rates.\nCollapse", "400": "This paper estimates the effects on energy and oil demand of changes in income and oil prices, for 96 of the world's largest countries, in per-capita terms. We examine three important issues: the asymmetric effects on demand of increases and decreases in oil prices; the asymmetric effects on demand of increases and decreases in income; and the different speeds of demand adjustment to changes in price and in income. Our main conclusions are the following: (1) OECD demand responds much more to increases in oil prices than to decreases; ignoring this asymmetric price response will bias downward the estimated response to income changes; (2) demand's response to income decreases in many Non-OECD countries is not necessarily symmetric to its response to income increases; ignoring this asymmetric income response will bias the estimated response to income changes; (3) the speed of demand adjustment is faster to changes in income than to changes in price; ignoring this difference will bias upward the estimated response to income changes. Using correctly specified equations for energy and oil demand, the longrun response in demand for income growth is about 1.0 for Non-OECD Oil Exporters, Income Growers and perhaps all Non-OECD countries, and about 0.55 For OECD countries. These estimates for developing countries are significantly higher than current estimates used by the US Department of Energy. Our estimates for the OECD countries are also higher than those estimated recently by Schmalensee-Stoker-Judson (1998) and Holtz-Eakin and Selden (1995), who ignore the (asymmetric) effects of prices on demand. Higher responses to income changes, of course, will increase projections of energy and oil demand, and of carbon dioxide emissions.\nCollapse", "401": "This paper examines the influence of oil prices on stock market time-varying correlation. Five stock market indices from both oil-importing (US, UK and Germany) and oil-exporting economies (Canada and Norway) are considered for the period 1988-2011. The findings from the DCC-GARCH framework suggest that the effects of oil price changes on stock market correlation are not constant over time and they depend on the status of the economy, i.e. whether it is oil-importing or oil-exporting. In addition, utilising the identification of oil price shocks in [1], [2] and [3] it is found that the aggregate demand shocks and precautionary demand shocks tend to exercise a negative effect on stock market correlation, whereas no effects from the supply-side oil price shocks can be reported. These findings have important implications for international portfolio diversifications and risk management.\nCollapse", "402": "Recent research has shown that recursive real-time VAR forecasts of the real price of oil tend to be more accurate than forecasts based on oil futures prices of the type commonly employed by central banks worldwide. Such monthly forecasts, however, differ in several important dimensions from the forecasts central banks require when making policy decisions. First, central banks are interested in forecasts of the quarterly real price of oil rather than forecasts of the monthly real price of oil. Second, many central banks are interested in forecasting the real price of Brent crude oil rather than any of the U.S. benchmarks. Third, central banks outside the United States are interested in forecasting the real price of oil measured in domestic consumption units rather than U.S. consumption units. Addressing each of these three concerns involves modeling choices that affect the relative accuracy of alternative forecasting methods. In addition, we investigate the costs and benefits of allowing for time variation in VAR model parameters and of constructing forecast combinations. We conclude that quarterly forecasts of the real price of oil from suitably designed VAR models estimated on monthly data generate the most accurate forecasts among a wide range of methods including forecasts based on oil futures prices, nochange forecasts and forecasts based on models estimated on quarterly data.\nCollapse", "403": "This paper investigates the role of oil prices in explaining the dynamics of selected emerging countries' exchange rates.

The paper's aim is to inform olive oil stakeholders about consumer preferences regarding extra-virgin olive oil attributes, that include area of origin, geographical designation (PDO and PGI), organic certification and price. The aforementioned attributes constitute an additional factor of overall perceived quality, and verify if the perception of quality varies among consumers in different geographic areas. Findings emphasise the leading role that price plays and highlights how Italian olive oil consumers are positively influenced by an organic method of production and PDO certification. Furthermore, consumers from traditional olive oil production areas tend to identify their local extra-virgin olive oil as superior to others. Consumers from areas not traditionally olive oil producers consider price to be an indicator of quality and often purchase more expensive extra-virgin olive oil.\nCollapse", "406": "This paper aims to explore the links between Brent crude oil index and stock markets index in OECD countries.

Furthermore, we find that different geographical regions respond differently to oil supply shocks and oilspecific demand shocks that drive up oil prices, with Europe and North America being more negatively affected than emerging economies in Asia and South America. We demonstrate that this heterogeneity in responses is not only attributable to differences in energy intensity in production across regions but also to degree of openness and the investment share in GDP.\nCollapse", "408": "This paper explores the information content of several variables on the so-called \"oil price premium over fundamentals\".

In this paper, we study how this development affected prices for refined products, focusing on the markets for motor gasoline and diesel. We find that the relative decrease in Midwest crude oil prices did not pass through to wholesale gasoline and diesel prices. This result is consistent with evidence that the marginal gallon of fuel in the Midwest is still imported from coastal locations. Our findings imply that investments in new pipeline infrastructure between the Midwest and the Gulf Coast, such as the southern segment of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, will not raise gasoline prices in the Midwest.\nCollapse", "411": "In this research, we examine the effects of El Ni~no southern oscillation (ENSO) on market dynamics of major vegetable oil prices. We adopt a smooth transition vector error correction modelling framework to analyse the impacts of ENSO events on the vegetable oil prices and, more interestingly, to investigate the asymmetric nature of the ENSO dynamics and price responses to ENSO shocks. The results confirm selfexciting type nonlinearities in the ENSO dynamics, and presence of the so-called transactions cost band in the system of vegetable oil prices. These nonlinearities yield the history-specific asymmetries in the vegetable oil price dynamics, wherein effects of ENSO shocks on the ENSO dynamics and the vegetable oil prices vary considerably between different ENSO regimes. In general, positive deviations, El Ni~no events, result in the vegetable oil price increase, while negative deviations, La Ni~na events, result in decrease in the prices.

The regimes are characterized by markedly different price adjustment behaviors. Before 2005 and from late 2007 onward, a regime characterized by the strong orientation of biodiesel prices toward diesel prices dominates.

This finding casts doubt on claims that the new market risk disclosures do not reflect firms' risk exposures.

We conclude that the reductions in world oil demand following the oil price increases of the 1970s will not be completely reversed by the price cuts of the 1980s. The response to price cuts in the 1980s is perhaps only one-fifth that for price increases in the 1970s. This has dramatic implications for projections of oil demand, especially under low-price assumptions. We also consider the effect on demand of a price recovery (sub-maximum increase) in the 1990s-due either to OPEC or to a carbon tax-specifically whether the effects would be as large as for the price increases of the 1970s or only as large as the smaller demand reversals of the 1980s. On this the results are uncertain, but a tentative conclusion is that the response to a price recovery would lie midway between the small response to price cuts and the larger response to increases in the maximum historical price. Finally, We demonstrate two implications of wrongly assuming that demand is perfectly price-reversible. First, such an assumption will grossly overestimate the demand response to price declines of the 1980s.

Prices first tripled in response to an Arab embargo and then nearly doubled again when Iran dethroned its Shah, sending the major economies sputtering into recession. Many analysts warned that these crises proved that the world would soon run out of oil. Yet they were wrong. Their dire predictions were emotional and political reactions; even at the time, oil experts knew that they had no scientific basis. Just a few years earlier oil explorers had discovered enormous new oil provinces on the north slope of Alaska and below the North Sea off the coast of Europe.

We first document a remarkable structural change in the oil market itself, i.e. a considerably steeper, hence, less elastic oil demand curve since the mid-eighties. Accordingly, a typical oil supply shock is currently characterized by a much smaller impact on world oil production and a greater effect on the real price of crude oil, but has a similar impact on US output and inflation as in the 1970s. Second, we find a smaller role for oil supply shocks in accounting for real oil price variability over time, implying that current oil price fluctuations are more demand driven. Finally, while unfavorable oil supply disturbances explain little of the \"Great Inflation\", they seem to have contributed to the 1974/75, early 1980s and 1990s recessions but also dampened the economic boom at the end of the millennium.\nCollapse", "434": "Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock and the 9/11 terrorist attack. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment and productivity. Thus, second moment shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to VAR estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing.

Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.\nCollapse", "435": "This paper tests whether innovations in macroeconomic variables are risks that are rewarded in the stock market.

In recent years such models have been increasingly used to identify demand and supply shocks in the market for crude oil. We demonstrate that sign restrictions alone are insufficient to infer the responses of the real price of oil to such shocks. Moreover, the conventional assumption that all admissible models are equally likely is routinely violated in oil market models, calling into question the use of median responses to characterize the responses to structural shocks. When combining sign restrictions with additional empirically plausible bounds on the magnitude of the short-run oil supply elasticity and on the impact response of real activity, however, it is possible to reduce the set of admissible model solutions to a small number of qualitatively similar estimates. The resulting model estimates are broadly consistent with earlier results regarding the relative importance of demand and supply shocks for the real price of oil based on structural VAR models identified by exclusion restrictions, but imply very different dynamics from the median responses in VAR models based on sign restrictions only.\nCollapse", "440": "This paper develops and empirically tests a two-factor model for pricing financial and real assets contingent on the price of oil.

In contrast, the very short term relationship between oil prices and exchange rates at the daily frequency is rather robust, and holds no matter whether we use contemporaneous (realized) or lagged oil price shocks in our regression.

The first model is a simple one-factor model 'in which the logarithm of the spot price of the commodity is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. The second model takes into account a second stochastic factor, the convenience yield of the commodity, which is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. Finally, the third model also includes stochastic interest rates. The Kalman filter methodology is used to estimate the parameters of the three models for two commercial commodities, copper and oil, and one precious metal, gold. The analysis reveals strong mean reversion in the commercial commodity prices. Using the estimated parameters, we analyze the implications of the models for the term structure of futures prices and volatilities beyond the observed contracts, and for hedging contracts for future delivery. Finally, we analyze the implications of the models for capital budgeting decisions. THE STOCHASTIC BEHAVIOR OF commodity prices plays a central role in the models for valuing financial contingent claims on the commodity, and in the procedures for evaluating investments to extract or produce the commodity. Earlier studies, by assuming that interest rates and convenience yields are constant allowed for a straight forward extension of the procedures developed for common stock option pricing to the valuation of financial and real commodity contingent claims. The assumption, however, is clearly not very satisfactory since it implies that the volatility of future prices is equal to the volatility of spot prices, and that the distribution of future spot prices under the equivalent martingale measure has a variance that increases without bound as the horizon increases.

In the 2000s, and at least until the end of 2007, even larger increases in the price of oil were associated with much milder movements in output and inflation. Using a structural VAR approach Blanchard and Gali (2007a) argued that this has reflected in large part a change in the causal relation from the price of oil to output and inflation. In order to shed light on the possible factors behind the decrease in the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks, we develop a new-Keynesian model, with imported oil used both in production and consumption, and we use a minimum distance estimator that minimizes, over the set of structural parameters and for each of the two samples (pre and post 1984), the distance between the empirical SVAR-based impulse response functions and those implied by the model. Our results point to two relevant changes in the structure of the economy, which have modified the transmission mechanism of the oil shock: vanishing wage indexation and an improvement in the credibility of monetary policy.

Approaching the data from several angles, we find that the impact of higher oil prices on oil-importing economies is generally small: a 25 percent increase in oil prices typically causes GDP to fall by about half of one percent or less. While cross-country differences in impact are found to depend mainly on the relative size of oil imports, we also show that oil price shocks are not always costly for oil-importing countries: although higher oil prices increase the import bill, there are partly offsetting increases in external receipts. We provide a small open economy model illustrating the main transmission channels of oil shocks, and show how the recycling of petrodollars may mitigate the impact.\nCollapse", "455": "Using a volatility spillover model, we find evidence of significant spillovers from crude oil prices to corn cash and futures prices, and that these spillover effects are time\u2010varying.

Third, we find that the relative factor price of labor to capital, and capital intensity in manufacturing sectors appreciate as windfall increases. Fourth, we find that manufacturing sectors with higher capital intensity are less affected by windfall shocks than their peers, possibly due to a larger share of the effect being absorbed by more laborintensive tradable sectors.

Second, we point out that the size of the effect that Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson attribute to oil shocks is substantially smaller than that reported by other researchers, primarily due to their choice of a shorter lag length than that used by other researchers.

Interestingly, the dynamic of the stock market has always been considered to be in line with macroeconomic activities and often has a positive relation to oil price changes.

First, we find that the underlying source of the oil price shift is crucial to determine the repercussions on the economy and the appropriate monetary policy reaction. Second, the transmission mechanism is considerably different compared to the US. In particular, inflationary effects in the US are mainly driven by a strong direct pass-through of rising energy prices and indirect effects of higher production costs. In contrast, Euro area inflation reacts sluggishly and is much more driven by second-round effects of increasing wages.

The results of the Cheung-Ng procedure show that variation in oil prices does not Granger cause the variance in food and agricultural raw material prices.

Further analysis shows that these results may be due to our oil price measures serving as proxies for a recently developed measure of global real economic activity omitted from the alternatives to the benchmark forecasting models in which we only use lags of GDP growth. By way of density forecast OOS comparisons, we find evidence of such oil price predictability for GDP for our full 1970-2009 OOS period.

In the 2000s, and at least until the end of 2007, even larger increases in the price of oil were associated with much milder movements in output and inflation. Using a structural VAR approach Blanchard and Gali (2007a) argued that this has reflected in large part a change in the causal relation from the price of oil to output and inflation. In order to shed light on the possible factors behind the decrease in the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks, we develop a new-Keynesian model, with imported oil used both in production and consumption, and we use a minimum distance estimator that minimizes, over the set of structural parameters and for each of the two samples (pre- and post 1984), the distance between the empirical SVAR-based impulse response functions and those implied by the model. Our results point to two relevant changes in the structure of the economy, which have modified the transmission mechanism of the oil shock: vanishing wage indexation and an improvement in the credibility of monetary policy.

Furthermore, it is shown that changes in oil prices or in oil price volatility do not lead to a higher probability of switching between regimes.\nCollapse", "485": "The rapid upward shift in ethanol demand has raised concerns about ethanol\u2019s impact on the price level and volatility of agricultural commodities. The popular press attributes much of this volatility in commodity prices to a price bubble in ethanol fuel and recent deflation.

This volatility in ethanol and commodity prices are investigated using cointegration, vector error corrections (VECM), and multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedascity (MGARCH) models. In terms of derived demand theory, results support ethanol and oil demands as derived demands from vehicle-fuel production. Gasoline prices directly influence the prices of ethanol and oil. However, of greater significance for the fuel versus food security issue, results support the effect of agricultural commodity prices as market signals which restore commodity markets to their equilibriums after a demand or supply event (shock). Such shocks may in the short-run increase agricultural commodity prices, but decentralized freely operating markets will mitigate the persistence of these shocks.

There are causal relations between each of the prices, and there is a negative relation between the value of the dollar and the price of each of the commodities, as predicted by standard economic theory.

As a result, the price of glycerol has fallen significantly and biodiesel refiners are faced with limited options for managing the glycerol by-product, which in the biodiesel industry, has essentially become a waste stream.

Next, the paper deduces the changing trends of oil prices by the limit probability of a Markov Chain. We then undertake a probability distribution analysis and find that the oil price series have a log-normality distribution. On this basis, we integrate the two models to deduce the changing trends of oil prices from the short-term to the middle- and long-terms, thus making our deduction academically sound.

These suspicions and concerns were escalated during the oil price increase from 2005 \u2013 2008 and the subsequent but probably related market collapse of 2008. We believe that Energy Return On Investment (EROI) analysis provides a useful approach for examining disadvantages and advantages of different fuels and also offers the possibility to look into the future in ways that markets seem unable to do. The goal of this paper is to review the application of EROI theory to both natural and economic realms, and to assess preliminarily the minimum EROI that a society must attain from its energy exploitation to support continued economic activity and social function. In doing so we calculate herein a basic first attempt at the minimum EROI for current society and some of the consequences when that minimum is approached. The theory of the minimum EROI discussed here, which describes the somewhat obvious but nonetheless important idea that for any being or system to survive or grow it must gain substantially more energy than it uses in obtaining that energy, may be especially important. Thus any particular being or system must abide by a \u201cLaw of Minimum EROI\u201d, which we calculate for both oil and corn-based ethanol as about 3:1 at the mine-mouth/farm-gate.

We show that the response of the external sector depends critically on the structure of financial market risk-sharing. Under incomplete markets, higher oil prices reduce the relative wealth of an oil-importing country, and induce its nonoil terms of trade to deteriorate, and its nonoil trade balance to improve. The magnitude of the nonoil terms of trade response hinges on structural parameters that affect the divergence in wealth effects across oil importers and exporters, including the elasticity of substitution between oil and other inputs in production, and the discount factor. By contrast, cross-country wealth differences effectively disappear under complete markets, with the implication that oil shocks have essentially no effect on the nonoil terms of trade or the nonoil trade balance.\nCollapse", "526": "Abstract: The coincident rise in crude oil prices and increased numbers of financial participants in the crude oil futures market from 2000-2008 has led to allegations that \"speculators\" drive crude oil prices.

This implies that small disturbances on either side of the oil market currently generate large price reactions but only modest quantity adjustments.

This finding reflects the financialization of the commodity markets and helps explain the large increase in the price volatility of non-energy commodities around 2008. Since the early 2000s, commodity futures have emerged as a popular asset class for many financial institutions. As a result, investment flows on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars have entered the commodity markets. Various observers and policymakers have expressed a strong concern that index investment as a form of financial speculation might have caused unwarranted increases in the cost of energy and food and induced excessive price volatility. What is the economic impact of the rapid growth of commodity index investment? Prior to the early 2000s, despite the liquid futures contracts traded on many commodities, academic researchers documented several characteristics indicating that commodity markets were partly segmented from outside financial markets and from each other: The commodity prices provided a risk premium for idiosyncratic commodity price risk and had little comovement with stocks and with each other. Recognition of the potential diversification benefits of investing in the segmented commodity markets prompted the rapid growth of commodity index investment after the early 2000s and precipitated a fundamental process of financialization among commodity markets. In our study, we analyzed the effects of this financialization process. Our analysis focused on a salient empirical pattern of greatly increased price comovements between various commodities after 2004, when significant index investment started to flow into commodity markets. Because index investors typically focus on strategic portfolio allocation between the commodity class and other asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, they tend to trade in and out of all commodities in a given index at the same time. As a result, their increasing presence should have a greater impact on commodities in the two most popular commodity indices\u2014the S&P GSCI and the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index (DJ-UBSCI)\u2014than on commodities off the indices. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that futures prices of non-energy commodities became increasingly correlated with oil after 2004. In particular, this trend was significantly more pronounced for indexed commodities than for off-index commodities after controlling for a set of alternative arguments. Although this trend intensified after the world financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, its presence was already evident and significant before the crisis. We also documented an increasing return correlation between commodities and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in recent years, which confirms the rising importance of commodity demands from rapidly growing emerging economies in determining commodity prices. However, comovements of commodity futures prices in China remained stable over 2006\u20132008, in sharp contrast to the large increases in the United States. This contrast suggests that the increases in commodity price comovements were not caused solely by changes in the supply of and demand for commodities driven by emerging economies. It is also important to note the sharp contrast between the high commodity return correlations of the last few years and those of the 1970s and early 1980s, when persistent oil supply shocks and stagflation hit the U.S. economy: The high correlations in the recent period were not only larger in magnitude but also different in nature. They emerged while inflation and inflation volatility remained subdued throughout the past decade. We would expect the growing presence of commodity index investors to affect the commodity markets in various ways. On the one hand, their presence can lead to a more efficient sharing of commodity price risk; on the other hand, their portfolio rebalancing can spill price volatility from outside markets on and across commodity markets. Consistent with the volatility spillover effect, our analysis shows that in 2008, indexed non-energy commodities had higher price volatility than did off-index commodities, and this difference was partly related to the greater return correlations of indexed commodities with oil. The changes induced by the index investment flows in commodity price correlation and volatility have profound implications on a wide range of issues, from commodity producers\u2019 hedging strategies and speculators\u2019 investment strategies to many countries\u2019 energy and food policies.\nCollapse", "533": "In this paper, we distinguish between factor/output substitution and shifts in the production technology frontier.

On average, we find substantial oil price-induced technological progress at the world level when long-term oil prices are rising, although the growth rate is more volatile in developed countries than in developing countries. The results also show that developed countries experience higher exogenous technological progress in comparison with developing countries, and the gap between the two has increased during the period of our study.\nCollapse", "534": "Prompted by the contemporaneous spike in coal, oil, and natural gas prices, this paper evaluates the degree of market integration both within and between crude oil, coal, and natural gas markets.

On the other hand, coal prices at five trading locations across the United States are cointegrated, but the degree of market integration is much weaker, particularly between Western and Eastern coals. Finally, we show that crude oil, coal, and natural gas markets are only very weakly integrated. Our results indicate that there is not a primary energy market.

A tremendous amount of space in the popular and professional literature has been devoted to analyzing the impacts of these shocks on the developed economies and the adjustments these shocks have induced. One residual of this literature has been a general impression that since 1973 the functional relationship between crude oil prices and the developed macroeconomies has been dramatically and fundamentally altered. Yet, to our knowledge, no one has formally tested this impression. Recent evidence of Hamilton (1983) suggests that crude oil prices had a strong impact on the U.S. business cycle well before 1973. Further, while textbook treatments of oil price shocks tend to highlight cost-push inflationary effects, the research of Berndt and Wood (1975, 1979) and Wilcox (1983) indicates the net complementarity between energy and capital in the U.S. economy is quite strong both before and after 1973.

This paper addresses this question using the identifying assumption that only supply shocks, such as shocks to technology, oil prices, and labor supply affect output in the long-run. Real and monetary aggregate demand shocks can affect output, but only in the short-run. This assumption sufficiently restricts the reduced form of key macroeconomic variables to allow estimation of the shocks and their effect on output and price at all frequencies. Aggregate demand shocks account for about 20 percent to 30 percent of output fluctuations at business cycle frequencies. Technological shocks account for about 1/4 of cyclical fluctuations, and about 1/3 of output's variance at low frequencies. Shocks to oil prices are important in explaining episodes in the 1970s and 1980s. Shocks that permanently affect labor input account for the balance of fluctuations in output, namely, about half of its variance at all frequencies.\nCollapse", "539": "This paper presents evidence of an important decline during recent decades in the pass-through from the price of oil to the general price level. We find that this decline is a generalized fact for a large set of countries. After documenting correlations between the consumer price index and oil prices, we use two estimation strategies in an attempt to properly identify the effect of oil shocks on inflation. First, we estimate the traditional Phillips curve augmented to include oil and test for structural breaks in 34 countries. This methodology shows a fall in the average estimated pass-through for industrial economies and, to a lesser degree, for emerging economies. Second, we estimate rolling vector autoregressions for a subsample of countries for which we have sufficient data. We derive impulse response functions of inflation to oil shocks and interpret the integrals as estimates of pass-through. We find that the effect of oil shocks on inflation has weakened for most of the 12 countries in the sample. Among the factors that might help to explain this decline, we argue that the most important are a reduction in the oil intensity of economies around the world, a reduction in the exchange rate pass-through, a more favorable inflation environment, and the fact that the current oil price shock is largely the result of strong world demand. These factors help to explain not only why the current shock has had limited inflationary effects, but also why it has had limited consequences for output.\nCollapse", "540": "The aim of this paper is to investigate the impacts of oil prices on the Chinese economy.

Rather than simply infer the oil price changes as oil supply shocks, we identify three different shocks in the crude oil market: the oil supply shock, the global aggregate demand shock, and the oil-market specific demand shock. We then use impulse response functions to compute the conditional oil price pass-through ratios. It is found that the largest oil price pass-through is caused by oil supply shocks. However, evidence from historical decompositions suggests that the oil price movements have been driven by shocks from strong global aggregate demand and oil demand while only minor contributions come from oil supply shocks. Disentangling demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market helps to uncover the fact that a recent decline in unconditional oil price pass-through may come from the low conditional pass-through caused by global demand shocks.\nCollapse", "542": "We build an equilibrium model of commodity markets in which speculators are capital constrained, and commodity producers have hedging demands for commodity futures. Increases in producers' hedging demand or speculators' capital constraints increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures.

Consistent with the model, measures of producers' propensity to hedge forecasts futures returns and spot prices in oil and gas market data from 1979 to 2010. The component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces. We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect equilibrium commodity supply and prices.\nCollapse", "543": "This paper considers the macroeconomics of the oil price for the United States. It investigates the impact of large oil price hikes in a standard VAR framework by introducing a new Markov switching based oil price specification. The explanatory power of this new specification is compared to that of a number of prominent non-linear specifications. The key findings are: (1) the new oil price specification is appropriate in both empirical and theoretical terms and allows for a well-founded distinction between OlargeO and OnormalO oil price increases. (2) The observed impact of oil price shocks on real GDP growth is largely attributable to no fewer than three large oil price increases, namely those of 1973-74, 1979 and 1991, while variables such as consumer and import prices are also affected by normal oil price increases.\nCollapse", "544": "If oil exporters stabilize the purchasing power of their export revenues in terms of imports, exchange rate developments (and particularly, developments in the US dollar/euro exchange rate) may contain information about oil price changes.

We give evidence that using information on the US dollar/euro exchange rate (and its determinants) improves oil price forecasts significantly.

Real oil prices did increase, indeed more than tripled, from $20 in 2001:Q4 to $62 in 2006:Q3 (in 2007 dollars). But the ailments associated with earlier oil-price increases did not appear. Instead output grew rapidly, inflation was moderate, unemployment fell, and consumers remained reasonably happy. (1) Macroeconomists would be out of business if there were no surprises. The business of this paper is to inquire into the explanations for the surprising oil noncrisis of the early to mid-2000s. The robustness of the economy following the latest oil shock can perhaps be seen in the context of an important historical development in macroeconomics, namely, the Great Moderation. Over the past half-century, the economy has shown declining volatility of inflation, unemployment, and output growth. (2) Perhaps the moderated response of the economy to the latest oil shock should be understood as part of this overall decline in volatility. Although much has been written about the macroeconomic impacts of price shocks, little analysis is available on the impact of the most recent oil price shock. (3) Most research focuses on the role of monetary policy and inflation dynamics in the wake of a shock. There seems to be no consensus as to whether the macroeconomic fear of oil-price shocks remains warranted. Comparing Shocks Past and Present To begin, I define an oil-price shock as an inward shift in the supply curve for crude oil triggered by political events exogenous to the oil market and the macroeconomy. The four oil-price shocks considered here, summary statistics for which are shown in table 1, are associated with the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the 1978 Iranian revolution, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the 2002 run-up to the American invasion of Iraq. Other periods might be considered, such as the price blip from 1998 to 2000 or the recovery from the OPEC price-cutting war of 1986, but these probably reflected cartel dynamics and were not clearly triggered by exogenous political events. The first date shown for each event in the table is that when the oil shock began, and the second is that when oil prices peaked. The first numerical column shows the corresponding percentage increase in the real price of oil from start to peak. (The oil price measure used here is the average refiner acquisition cost of crude oil, except during the period of price controls, 1973:Q3-1982:Q4, when it is the import cost. The oil price is deflated by the price index of personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.) The most recent event involved a real oil-price increase of 125 percent, close to the size of the 1978-81 increase but smaller than that in 1973-75. The next two columns show the macroeconomic response in terms of the unemployment rate and output (the latter expressed as the ratio of actual to potential GDP). The latest shock did not appear to have the recessionary impact on the economy seen in the three earlier shocks. The unemployment rate actually fell by slightly more than ! percentage point, and output grew slightly relative to potential. This contrasts sharply with the shocks of the 1970s, when the unemployment rate rose by between 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 percentage points and output declined sharply relative to potential. Although the latest oil shock did not lead to a recession, the impacts on inflation and productivity were in the same direction as those from the shocks of the 1970s. But the impacts were different in magnitude: inflation during the 2002-06 shock rose about 1 1/4 percentage points--much less than the sharp rise in the 1970s, and labor productivity growth declined by about 1/2 percentage point, less than the average in the 1970s as well. \u2026\nCollapse", "546": "This paper examines the time series econometric relationship between the Henry Hub natural gas price and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price.

We find a cointegrating relationship relating Henry Hub prices to the WTI and trend capturing the relative demand and supply effects over the 1989-through-2005 period. The dynamics of the relationship suggest a 1-month temporary shock to the WTI of 20 percent has a 5-percent contemporaneous impact on natural gas prices, but is dissipated to 2 percent in 2 months.

After presenting review of existing literature about oil effects on the UK\u2019s sectors of manufacturing and services, an econometric analysis is carried out. In a more detailed analysis, three sets of vector autoregressive (VAR) models are employed using linear and non-linear oil price specifications among several key macroeconomic variables. From the linear oil price specification VAR model, the impulse response function reveals that oil price movement causes positive effects in both the output of manufacturing and services sectors. The variance decomposition shows that oil prices are quite important as a cause of the variance of the UK services sector output, while they do not have such a large role in the variance of the UK\u2019s manufacturing output. From the asymmetric specification, it has been found that positive oil price changes determine a consistent contraction in manufacturing output, while the services sector does not seem to be affected by increases. Alternatively, negative oil price changes, show that manufacturing output does not increase so much despite a decrease in oil prices. The services sector is much more affected by oil prices decreases than increases. Finally considering the net oil price increase (NOPI) specification, it has been found that the manufacturing sector is much more affected by oil price changes than the services sector.\nCollapse", "548": "Changes in firms' investment expenditures are considered one of the primary channels through which energy price shocks are transmitted to the economy. It is widely believed that the response of business fixed investment to energy price increases differs from its response to energy price decreases. We show that the apparent symmetry in the estimated responses of business fixed investment in equipment and structures cannot be reconciled with standard theoretical explanations of asymmetric responses. Rather this evidence is an artifact (1) of the aggregation of mining-related expenditures by the oil, natural gas, and coal mining industry and all other expenditures, and (2) of ignoring an exogenous shift in investment caused by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. After controlling for these factors, formal statistical tests are unable to reject the hypothesis of symmetric responses to energy price shocks for all components of investment in structures. For nonresidential equipment there is weak statistical evidence of classical asymmetries in some components, but not in the aggregate. Once symmetry is imposed and mining-related expenditures are excluded, the estimated response of business fixed investment in equipment and structures tends to be small and statistically insignificant. Historical decompositions show that energy price shocks have played a minor role in driving fluctuations in nonresidential fixed investment other than investment in mining.\nCollapse", "549": "HOUSE PRICES have recently attracted unusual attention because for the first time in decades large areas in the United States have experienced declining nominal house prices.

With rising energy prices, it is important to consider oil as a pricing factor in asset pricing models. Design/methodology/approach - Multifactor static and dynamic models consider crude oil and other macroeconomic factors as pricing factors in industry excess returns from January 1980 to August 2006. The macroeconomic factors comprise the market portfolio, oil prices, exchange rates and the term premium. The industries consist of banking, diversified financials, energy, insurance, media, property trusts, materials, retailing and transportation. Findings - Oil prices are an important determinant of returns in the banking, energy, materials, retailing and transportation industries. The findings also suggest oil price movements are persistent. Nonetheless, the proportion of variation in excess returns explained by the contemporaneous and lagged oil prices appears to have declined during the sample period. Research limitations/implications - Macroeconomic factors are important for multifactor asset pricing at the industry level. Apart from oil prices, the market portfolio is a significant pricing factor in all industry excess returns. Exchange rates are also an influential factor for excess returns in the banking and diversified financials industries, and the term premium as a proxy for future real activity is a priced factor in the energy, insurance and retailing industries.

Prior work argues that oil prices and the GCC stock markets are not related. This conclusion could be due to the fact that only linear linkages have been examined. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs newly developed techniques of rank tests of nonlinear cointegration analysis proposed by Breitung and Gourieroux and Breitung. The Breitung's method is selected in this study due its potential superiority at detecting cointegration when the error-correction mechanism is nonlinear. Findings - The empirical analysis of the paper supports that oil price impact the stock price indices in GCC countries in a nonlinear fashion. Thus, the statistical analysis in this paper obviously supports a nonlinear modeling of the relationship between oil and the economy. Research limitations/implications - The paper contains the normal limitations associated with the econometric method including statistical bias. Practical implications - The implication of this paper findings is that policy makers at GCC countries should keep an eye on the effects of changes in oil price levels on their own economies and stock markets. For individual and institutional investors, the nonlinear relationship between oil and stock markets imply predictability in the GCC stock markets. Originality/value - The paper presents new findings on the relationships between oil prices and the stock market in GCC countries. These findings should be of interest to researchers, regulators, and market participants.\nCollapse", "555": "Changes in oil prices predict stock market returns worldwide. We find significant predictability in both developed and emerging markets. These results cannot be explained by time-varying risk premia as oil price changes also significantly predict negative excess returns. Investors seem to underreact to information in the price of oil. A rise in oil prices drastically lowers future stock returns. Consistent with the hypothesis of a delayed reaction by investors, the relation between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes strengthens once we introduce lags of several trading days between monthly stock returns and lagged monthly oil price changes.\nCollapse", "556": "This paper investigates whether the real oil price has an impact on the real exchange rates of three main oil-exporting countries: Norway, Russia and Saudi Arabia. We create our measure of the real effective exchange rates for Norway and Saudi Arabia (1980-2006) and for Russia (1995-2006), testing if real oil prices and productivity differentials against 15 OECD countries influence exchange rates. In the case of Russia it is possible to establish a positive long-run relationship between the real oil price and the real exchange rate. However, we find virtually no impact of the real oil price on the real exchange rates of Norway and Saudi Arabia. The diverse exchange rate regimes cannot help in explaining the different empirical results on the impact of oil prices across countries, which instead may be due to other policy responses, namely the accumulation of net foreign assets and their sterilisation, and specific institutional characteristics.

We first document a remarkable structural change in the oil market itself, i.e. a considerably steeper, hence, less elastic oil demand curve since the mid-eighties. Accordingly, a typical oil supply shock is currently characterized by a much smaller impact on world oil production and a greater effect on the real price of crude oil, but has a similar impact on US output and inflation as in the 1970s. Second, we find a smaller role for oil supply shocks in accounting for real oil price variability over time, implying that current oil price fluctuations are more demand driven. Finally, while unfavorable oil supply disturbances explain little of the \"Great Inflation\", they seem to have contributed to the 1974/75, early 1980s and 1990s recessions but also dampened the economic boom at the end of the millennium.\nCollapse", "558": "This paper investigates the impact of changes in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate on crude oil prices.

We use this period \u00d0 which for natural gas markets displays an unusual combination of deregulation and autarky \u00d0 as a natural experiment to explore if decoupling of natural gas prices from prices of other energy commodities, such as oil and electricity, took place. Monthly price data in the period 1995-1998 indicates a highly integrated market where wholesale demand seems to be for energy rather than a specific energy source.\nCollapse", "560": "Changes in firms' investment expenditures are considered one of the primary channels through which energy price shocks are transmitted to the economy. It is widely believed that the response of business fixed investment to energy price increases differs from its response to energy price decreases. We show that the apparent symmetry in the estimated responses of business fixed investment in equipment and structures cannot be reconciled with standard theoretical explanations of asymmetric responses. Rather this evidence is an artifact (1) of the aggregation of mining-related expenditures by the oil, natural gas, and coal mining industry and all other expenditures, and (2) of ignoring an exogenous shift in investment caused by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. After controlling for these factors, formal statistical tests are unable to reject the hypothesis of symmetric responses to energy price shocks for all components of investment in structures. For nonresidential equipment there is weak statistical evidence of classical asymmetries in some components, but not in the aggregate. Once symmetry is imposed and mining-related expenditures are excluded, the estimated response of business fixed investment in equipment and structures tends to be small and statistically insignificant. Historical decompositions show that energy price shocks have played a minor role in driving fluctuations in nonresidential fixed investment other than investment in mining.\nCollapse", "561": "This paper empirically assesses the impact of oil price shocks on the underlying non-oil economic cycle in oil-exporting countries.

The existing evidence on stock prices and exchange rates typically relies on introduction of a global market index. On the contrary, we find that for the countries of our sample oil prices emerge as the dominant factor in the above relationship. When we focus on the extended sample we do not detect evidence of cointegration between stock prices and real exchange rates, or of cointegration among stock prices, real exchange rates and other exogenous variables such as the US stock price or the oil price. To address the possibility that this finding may be due to the presence of regime shifts we, first, divide the sample into two subperiods based on the oil price shock in March 1999. The Johansen trace statistics reveals evidence of cointegration only for the second subsample, among stock prices, real exchange rates and oil prices in Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and between stock prices and oil prices in Kuwait. Utilizing the full sample and including deterministic dummies in the VECM we attempt to capture the regime shifts. The FIML estimation results corroborate the finings from splitting the sample, indicating that the oil prices have a longrun positive effect on stock market in each country. Readjustment towards the long-run equilibrium in each stock market occurs via oil price changes. Finally, we produce persistence profiles showing that convergence to the long run equilibrium takes 17 and 14 months in Egypt and Saudi Arabia respectively, while it takes 22 and 24 moths in Oman and Kuwait. * (Corresponding Author) School of Accounting Finance and Management, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, UK.

We then investigate the optimal resolution of the policy tradeoffs emanating from oil-price disturbances. Our simulations show that the inflationary forces related to the use of oil as an intermediate good seem to require specific policy actions in the optimal allocation. However, the direct effects of oil prices should be allowed to exert their mechanical influence on CPI inflation and wage dynamics through the indexation schemes. We also illustrate that any fine-tuning strategy which tries to counteract the direct effects of oil-price changes in headline inflation would prove counterproductive both in terms to stabilization of underlying inflation and by causing unnecessary volatility in the macroeconomic landscape. Finally, it appears that perfect foresight on future oil price developments allows a more rapid absorption of the steady state decline in purchasing power and real national income in the optimal allocation. Through the various expectation channels, economic agents facilitate the necessary adjustments and optimal monetary policy can still tolerate the direct effects of oil price changes on CPI inflation as well as some degree of underlying inflationary pressures in the view of easing partly the burden of downward real wage shifts. Our monetary policy prescriptions have been derived in a modeling framework where oil-price fluctuations are essentially exogenous to policy actions and where expectations are formed under the rational expectations paradigm. Notably, the extension of such conclusions to imperfect knowledge and weak central bank credibility configurations remain challenging fields for further research.

The cheap supply of oil has been the engine for economic growth in the western world. Since future oil demand is expected to increase, the question to what extent future production will be available is important. The belief in a soon peak production of oil is fueled by increasing oil prices. However, the reliability of the oil price as a single parameter can be questioned, as earlier times of high prices have occurred without having anything to do with a lack of oil. Instead, giant oil fields, the largest oil fields in the world, can be used as a parameter.A giant oil field contains at least 500 million barrels of recoverable oil. Only 507, or 1 % of the total number of fields, are giants. Their contribution is striking: over 60 % of the 2005 production and about 65 % of the global ultimate recoverable reserve (URR). However, giant fields are something of the past since a majority of the largest giant fields are over 50 years old and the discovery trend of less giant fields with smaller volumes is clear. A large number of the largest giant fields are found in the countries surrounding the Persian Gulf. The domination of giant fields in global oil production confirms a concept where they govern future production. A model, based on past annual production and URR, has been developed to forecast future production from giant fields. The results, in combination with forecasts on new field developments, heavy oil and oil sand, are used to predict future oil production.In all scenarios, peak oil occurs at about the same time as the giant fields peak. The worst-case scenario sees a peak in 2008 and the best-case scenario, following a 1.4 % demand growth, peaks in 2018.\nCollapse", "566": "Using high-frequency data the co-movements among crude oil prices are analysed in order to address the question of regionalization of the world crude oil market.

As a consequence, we argued that assessments of the importance of monetary policy for real activity should take into account the systematic portion of policy (i.e., the policy rule) as well as the unsystematic component (i.e., monetary policy shocks.) The specific type of exogenous shock that we considered in BGW was a sharp increase in the price of oil, of the magnitude observed during several episodes in the 1970s. Using a modified VAR framework, we considered counterfactual scenarios in which monetary policy (represented by the level of the federal funds rate) does not respond to an oil price shock.

In a world where the international economy dramatically affects domestic developments, the question of where institutions come from becomes at once more urgent and more complex. In both Saudi Arabia and Yemen, fundamental state and market institutions forged during a period of isolation at the end of World War I were destroyed and reshaped not once but three times in response to exogenous shocks. Comparing boom-bust cycles, Chaudhry exposes the alternating social and organizational origins of institutions, arguing that both broad changes in the international economy and specific forms of international integration shape institutional outcomes.

However, one of the main challenges facing econometric models is to forecast such seemingly unpredictable economic series. Traditional linear structural models have not been promising when used for oil price forecasting. Although linear and nonlinear time series models have performed much better in forecasting oil prices, there is still room for improvement. If the data generating process is nonlinear, applying linear models could result in large forecast errors. Model specification in nonlinear modeling, however, can be very case dependent and time-consuming. In this paper, we model and forecast daily crude oil futures prices from 1983 to 2003, listed in NYMEX, applying ARIMA and GARCH models. We then test for chaos using embedding dimension, BDS(L), Lyapunov exponent, and neural networks tests. Finally, we set up a nonlinear and flexible ANN model to forecast the series. Since the test results indicate that crude oil futures prices follow a complex nonlinear dynamic process, we expect that the ANN model will improve forecasting accuracy.

In advanced economies, following severe deteriorations during the crisis, many indicators of fiscal space have virtually returned to levels in the mid-2000s. In contrast, fiscal space has shrunk in many emerging market and developing economies since the crisis. Second, financial crises tend to coincide with deterioration in multiple indicators of fiscal space, but they are often followed by reduced reliance on short-term borrowing.

Consequently, exaggerated capital discipline among oil and gas companies may have reduced their willingness to invest for future reserves and production growth. Based on panel data for 14 international oil and gas companies for the period 1990-2003, we seek to establish econometric relations between market valuation on one hand, and simple financial and operational indicators on the other.

The mechanism behind this unbalance is clear enough: part of the oil revenues is spent on non-traded goods which leads to a real appreciation (i.e., a rise in the relative price of non-traded goods in terms of traded goods). This in turn draws resources out of the non-oil traded sector into the non-traded goods producing sector (Corden and Neary (1982); van Wijnbergen (1980)).

In this paper, we use a general equilibrium model to assess the extent to which these two mechanisms reduce the effectiveness of OECD reductions in curbing global CO2 concentrations.\nCollapse", "603": "We analyze the dynamics of global fossil resource markets under different assumptions for the supply of fossil fuel resources, development pathways for energy demand, and climate policy settings. Resource markets, in particular the oil market, are characterized by a large discrepancy between costs of resource extraction and commodity prices on international markets. We explain this observation in terms of (a) the intertemporal scarcity rent, (b) regional price differentials arising from trade and transport costs, (c) heterogeneity and inertia in the extraction sector. These effects are captured by the REMIND model. We use the model to explore economic effects of changes in coal, oil and gas markets induced by climate-change mitigation policies. A large share of fossil fuel reserves and resources will be used in the absence of climate policy leading to atmospheric GHG concentrations well beyond a level of 550 ppm CO2-eq. This result holds independently of different assumptions about energy demand and fossil fuel availability. Achieving ambitious climate targets will drastically reduce fossil fuel consumption, in particular the consumption of coal. Conventional oil and gas as well as non-conventional oil reserves are still exhausted. We find the net present value of fossil fuel rent until 2100 at 30tril.US$ with a large share of oil and a small share of coal. This is reduced by 9 and 12tril.US$ to achieve climate stabilization at 550 and 450 ppm CO2-eq, respectively. This loss is, however, overcompensated by revenues from carbon pricing that are 21 and 32tril.US$, respectively. The overcompensation also holds under variations of energy demand and fossil fuel supply.\nCollapse", "604": "Countries with oil, mineral or other natural resource wealth, on average, have failed to show better economic performance than those without, often because of undesirable side effects.

When the news was not so bad as feared the dollar fell back in I974, but rose in I979. In 1980 the pattern shifted once again, back to dollar appreciation.

Our statistical estimates suggest current oil price increases are likely to have only a modest effect on inflation in the U.S, Japan, and Europe. Oil price increases of as much as 10 percentage points will lead to direct inflationary increases of about 0.1-0.8 percentage points in the U.S. and the E.U.

This paper takes three steps that attempt to address these challenges. First, we develop an instrumental variables strategy that exploits firms\u2019 differential exposure to energy and currency prices and volatility. For example, airlines are negatively affected by high oil prices while oil refiners benefit from them, but both are sensitive to oil price volatility; retailers, in comparison, are not particularly sensitive to either the level or volatility of oil prices. Second, we use the expected volatility of stock prices as implied by equity options to obtain forward-looking measures of uncertainty over firms\u2019 business conditions. Finally, we examine how uncertainty affects a range of outcomes: capital investment, hiring, research and development, and advertising. We find that uncertainty depresses capital investment, hiring, and advertising, but encourages R&D spending. This perhaps-surprising result for R&D is consistent with a theoretical literature emphasizing that long investment lags create valuable real put options which offset the effects of call options lost when projects are started.

With oil trading at $90 a barrel, government coffers in these countries are overflowing with the oil windfall, and stock markets there are booming.

Large oil-exporting economies that border the Persian Gulf peg to the dollar even more tightly than China does while some others peg to a basket of currencies of oil-importing countries--mainly the dollar and the euro. These economies are making a policy mistake. They would be better served by a currency regime that assures their currencies depreciate when the price of oil falls and appreciate when the price of oil rises. Those that lack the institutions to conduct an autonomous monetary policy should peg to a basket that includes the price of oil. Exchange rate flexibility would reduce the need for domestic prices in the oil-exporting economies to rise and fall along with the price of oil, create additional room for monetary policy to reflect domestic conditions, and help oil-exporting economies manage the large swings in government revenue that accompany large swings in the oil price.

Though the U.S. economy has apparently absorbed this supply shock well so far, the path of future oil prices remains a concern for monetary policymakers. Higher oil prices can damp demand, as consumers and firms spend more of their budgets on oil-related products and less on other goods and services. Furthermore, if higher oil prices are passed through to a significant extent to other goods and services and ultimately wages, inflationary pressures can build. ; Is the price of oil likely to rise further, or will it decline gradually, as it did in the mid-1980s? A natural place to look for an answer is in the markets, where oil traders are knowledgeable about the industry and where their profits ride on making sound investments.

We examine firms primarily engaged in oil exploration and drilling since we can identify two kinds of risks to which these firms are exposed that can cause earnings volatility. These are oil price risk and exploration risk. While firms can hedge oil price risk with derivative instruments, markets do not exist in which firms can hedge the operational risk of unsuccessful drilling. Discretionary accrual choices can be used to reduce variability in earnings induced by the exploration risks and both discretionary accruals and hedging can reduce earnings variability associated with oil price fluctuations. We find that firms in our sample do not hedge all oil price risk they face, but instead appear to want to achieve some benchmark level of earnings volatility. In our primary analysis, we separate the decision to hedge oil price risk from the extent of hedging, and simultaneously consider the extent of hedging and the extent of smoothing with discretionary accruals. The results indicate that firms are more likely to hedge the higher the level of exploration risk they face. Moreover, after controlling for other determinants of hedging and discretionary accrual smoothing, we find that the extent of hedging and the extent of discretionary accrual smoothing are substitutes.\nCollapse", "632": "This paper identifies a structural break in core U.S. inflation Phillips curves such that oil prices contributed substantially before 1981, but since that time pass-through has been negligible.

In textbook accounts of rational choice, economists generally take an agnostic position on this question: a person's tastes are her own business, and rationality requires merely that she act efficiently in pursuit of whatever preferences she happens to hold. This approach affords obvious flexibility. A person's anonymous gift to charity, for example, can be readily explained as the consequence of a taste for helping others. But this flexibility comes at the expense of what George Stigler might have called the \"crankcase oil\" problem. If we see a person drink the used crankcase oil from his car, and he then writhes in agony and dies, we can assert that he must have really liked crankcase oil. (Why else would he have drunk it?) Virtually any behavior, no matter how bizarre, can be \"explained\" after the fact by simply assuming a taste for it. With this difficulty in mind, many economists assume -implicitly or explicitly-that people are essentially self-interested. Thus, in Gordon Tullock's words, \"the average human being is about 95 percent selfish in the narrow sense of the term\" [21; 12, 12]. This approach has generated many powerful insights into human behavior. It explains, for example, why car pools form in the wake of increases in gasoline prices and why the members of \"service\" organizations are more likely to be real estate salespersons, dentists, chiropractors, insurance agents, and others with something to sell than to be postal employees or airline pilots. But the assumption of selfishness is not without drawbacks of its own. The most apparent is that, for every behavior that is consistent with this assumption, there seems to be another that contradicts it. Travelers on interstate highways leave tips for waitresses they will never see again. People vote in presidential elections and they walk away from profitable transactions whose terms they believe to be \"unfair.\" Soldiers throw their bodies atop live grenades to save the lives of their comrades. In these and countless other ways, people do not seem to be maximizing utility functions of the egoistic sort.

In short, the monetary authority can use accommodative policy to cushion the negative effects of higher oil prices on real GDP, but at the expense of higher inflation.\nCollapse", "651": "For thirty years, dependence on oil has been a significant problem for the United States. Oil dependence is not simply a matter of how much oil we import. It is a syndrome, a combination of the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to higher oil prices and oil price shocks and a concentration of world oil supplies in a small group of oil producing states that are willing and able to use their market power to influence world oil prices. Although there are vitally important political and military dimensions to the oil dependence problem, this report focuses on its direct economic costs. These costs are the transfer of wealth from the United States to oil producing countries, the loss of economic potential due to oil prices elevated above competitive market levels, and disruption costs caused by sudden and large oil price movements. Several enhancements have been made to methods used in past studies to estimate these costs, and estimates of key parameters have been updated based on the most recent literature. It is estimated that oil dependence has cost the U.S. economy $3.6 trillion (constant 2000 dollars) since 1970, with the bulk of the losses occurring between 1979 and 1986. However, if oil prices in 2005 average $35-$45/bbl, as recently predicted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, oil dependence costs in 2005 will be in the range of $150-$250 billion. Costs are relatively evenly divided between the three components. A sensitivity analysis reflecting uncertainty about all the key parameters required to estimate oil dependence costs suggests that a reasonable range of uncertainty for the total costs of U.S. oil dependence over the past 30 years is $2-$6 trillion (constant 2000 dollars). Reckoned in terms of present value using a discount rate of 4.5%, the costs of U.S. oil dependence since 1970 are $8 trillion, with a reasonable range of uncertainty of $5 to $13 trillion.\nCollapse", "652": "This paper analyzes the economic effects of the oil and gas sector (energy booms) on manufacturing output in two energy producing countries: Norway and the United Kingdom. In particular, the author investigates whether there is evidence of a 'Dutch disease,' that is whether energy booms have had adverse effects on manufactures. In addition to energy booms, three other types of structural disturbances are identified; demand, supply, and oil price shocks. The different disturbances are identified by imposing dynamic restrictions on a vector autoregressive model. Overall, there is only weak evidence of a Dutch disease in the United Kingdom, whereas manufacturing output in Norway has actually benefited from energy discoveries and higher oil prices.

Exports of these commodities account for the bulk of export earnings of developing countries. The traditional demand-based framework was unable to explain the marked deterioration in these prices during the 1980s. This paper tries to ascertain the role played by real oil prices in explaining the extremely volatile movements in real prices of primary commodities by taking into account oil price shocks over the period 1973\u20131996, using monthly data. Real primary commodity prices and real oil prices are cointegrated.

We search for the optimal oil price level for the producer group, using a partial equilibrium model for the oil market. The model explicitly accounts for reserves, development and production in 4 field categories across 13 regions. Oil companies may invest in new field development or alternatively in improved oil recovery in the decline phase of fields in production. Non-OPEC production is profit-driven, whereas OPEC meets the residual call on OPEC oil at a pre-specified oil price, while maintaining a surplus capacity. According to our results, sustained high oil prices stimulate Non-OPEC production, but its remaining reserves gradually diminish despite new discoveries. Oil demand is only slightly affected by higher prices. Thus, OPEC is able to keep and eventually increase its current market share beyond 2010 even with oil prices around $30 per barrel (2000-$). In fact, an oil price around $40 seems to be profitable for OPEC, even if long-term revenues are not discounted. Sensitivity analyses show that even with many factors working jointly in OPEC's disfavour, the optimal oil price seems to be at least $25. Thus, for OPEC there is a trade-off between high prices and high market share in the short to medium term, but not in the long term. For OECD countries, on the other hand, there is a clear trade-off between low oil prices and low import dependence.\nCollapse", "656": "I investigate whether recognition and disclosure have equivalent pricing consequences in the oil and gas industry. I concentrate on the oil and gas industry because Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)Regulation SX [1978, sec. 210, para. 4-10] provides a unique opportunity for testing the stock price consequences of recognition versus disclosure. The SEC regulation requires the firm-specific effect of a macroeconomic event such as a major change in oil prices to be formally recognized in the financial statements for oil and gas firms adopting the full cost method but only disclosed in footnotes for firms following the successful efforts method. My results indicate that the effect of footnote disclosure on price differs from the effect of recognition. Whether users of financial statements distinguish between recognition and disclosure is often an important question in the debate over accounting standards. However, this question was never explicitly empirically tested (for a literature review, see Bernard and Schipper [1994]).

Several of these dimensions have received little attention in prior literature. A key finding is that exogenous emissions pricing (whether through a carbon tax or through the hybrid option) has a number of attractions over pure cap and trade. Beyond helping prevent price volatility and reducing expected policy errors in the face of uncertainties, exogenous pricing helps avoid problematic interactions with other climate policies and helps avoid large wealth transfers to oil exporting countries.\nCollapse", "659": "This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the effect of an oil price increase on exchange rates.

The model assumes stochastic, but mean reverting, risk adjusted oil spot prices, and includes a timing investment option. The results of using this real options model for evaluating a case study of an undeveloped oil field show that a significant fraction of the oil field value may be provided by the flexibility of delaying development investment, and that this flexibility value decreases as oil price increases. Also the critical price for developing decreases with the available time to develop. We illustrate the use that practitioner could make of the real option methodology to value oil contingent reserves by presenting a user friendly computer program with graphical interface.

The analysis is conducted using a model that incorporates different speeds of adjustment in goods and asset markets; domestic goods prices respond only sluggishly to excess demand while the exchange rate (and hence the price of imported goods) adjusts quickly. Monetary disinflation leads to reduced real balances, higher interest rates, and a lower nominal exchange rate. This causes a real appreciation and a decline in domestic manufacturing output in the short run. An increase in world oil prices can create similar effects even for a country that is a net oil exporter. Domestic oil discoveries, though finite, generate permanent income effects in demand that last beyond the productive life of the new oil reserve. Initially, current income is above permanent income, leading to an improvement in the trade account. This is eventually reversed when permanent income exceeds current income.

Several authors have argued that asymmetric and nonlinear transformations of oil prices restore that relationship and thus that the economy responds asymmetrically and nonlinearly to oil price shocks. In this paper, I show that this is only part of the story: the two leading such transformations do not in fact Granger cause output or unemployment in the post-1980 period without further refinements, and they derive much of their apparent success from data in the 1950s. If output is expressed in year-over-year changes, which are smoother than the usual quarterly changes, and the equations exclude variables like interest rates and inflation, then asymmetric and nonlinear oil prices predict output but not unemployment, while the real level of oil prices predicts unemployment but not output. I interpret this evidence as supportive of significant oil price effects on the macroeconomy which a) are at relatively low frequencies, b) are indirect, through variables like interest rates and inflation, c) can induce departures from Okun's law, and d) changed qualitatively around 1980.\nCollapse", "671": "This paper investigates how far OPEC influences world oil markets.

The result is that this impact is weak at best, and if at all then restricted to meetings recommending a price increase.

Consequently, the rise of oil prices in recent months has generated concern. We argue that the inflationary consequences of a rise in oil prices depend upon the policy response of the monetary authorities. They can ameliorate the short-term impacts on output, but only at the cost of higher inflation. In the short term, the size and distribution of output effects from an increase in oil prices depends on the intensity of oil use in production and on the speed at which oil producers spend their revenue. In the medium term, higher oil prices change the terms of trade between the OECD and the rest of the world and hence reduce the equilibrium level of output within the OECD. In this paper the authors first discuss oil market developments and survey previous studies on the impacts of oil price increases.

As a result of the integrated nature of the world oil market it is unlikely that any one nation acting on its own can implement policies that isolate its market from broader price behavior. As new major oil importers, notably China, and potentially India, expand their demand, the oil market likely will have to expand production capacity.

Finally, they find that despite the decline that has probably occurred during the current century in the terms of trade of nonfuel primary commodities, the purchasing power of total exports of these products has increased considerably.

Speculative price spikes built up, and the gap between spot and futures prices widened, stimulating overregulation and trader policing in some countries and causing some commodity exchanges in Africa and Asia to halt grain futures trading. Some food aid donors defaulted on food aid contracts. The World Food Programme (WFP) had difficulty getting access to enough grain quickly for its humanitarian operations. Developing countries began urgently rebuilding their national stocks and reexamining the \u201cmerits\u201d of self-sufficiency policies for food security. These reactions began as consequences, not causes, of the price crisis, but they exacerbated the crisis and increased the risks posed by high prices. By creating a positive feedback loop with high food prices, they took on a life of their own, increasing price levels and price volatility even more, with adverse consequences for the poor and for long-term incentives for agricultural production. Because they impeded the free flow of food to where it is most needed and the free flow of price signals to farmers, these market failures imposed enormous efficiency losses on the global food system, hitting the poorest countries hardest. Changes in supply and demand fundamentals cannot fully explain the recent drastic increase in food prices. Rising expectations, speculation, hoarding, and hysteria also played a role in the increasing level and volatility of food prices. The flow of speculative capital from financial investors into agricultural commodity markets has been drastic, and the number of future traded contracts is increasing over time. From May 2007 to May 2008, the volume of globally traded grain futures and options rose significantly. Excessive speculation in the commodity futures market could, in principle, push up futures prices and\u2014 through arbitrage opportunities\u2014spot prices above levels justified by supply and demand fundamentals. The supposed impact of speculation is sometimes confused, however, with the impact of hedging, which reflects consumers' genuine concerns about future fundamentals and desire to hedge against risks.

The point of departure was the major petroleum discoveries made in Norway, of which the writer is a citizen, and the potential of the petroleum sector to become the most important sector of the Norwegian economy. The Norwegian economy would consequently become dependent on the international petroleum market. The international price of petroleum is, however, determined in a most complex fashion owing to the noncompetitive behavior in this market. This book attempts to develop a framework to analyze the implications of the likely degree of noncompetitive behavior in the international petroleum market. The focus is on the market strategies that may be pursued by the worlds oil exporters on a joint or individual basis.

We analyse whether food price volatility is mainly induced by transfer of the oil price shock or if it is the consequence of a rising and competitive biofuel production. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of biofuels on land use as well. Food prices have lately surged and declined sharply and become more volatile. High fuel prices combined with a rising biofuel production created a link between crude oil and food prices. We investigated the impact of a biofuel production on an increased volatility in oil and food prices, and found correlations between cereals, sugar and vegetable oil price index and crude oil prices from 2003 to 2016. Our results show that the main driver for food price fluctuation is mainly the oil price shock. The increasing biofuel output has been associated with a rising protein-rich animal feed production. The use of co-products as animal feed has land use implications including GHG emission savings because co-products reduce land and the demand for chemical inputs required in the feed production.\nCollapse", "693": "This paper surveys OECD energy and oil demand over the past three decades, analyzing the different paths of transportation oil, non-transportation oil, and non-oil energy-both over time, and relative to income growth.

Mere has been an asymmetric, smaller demand response to the price decreases of the 1980s than to the price increases of the 1970s. We expect a smaller demand response to future price increases than to those of the 1970s. The demand response to future income growth will be not substantially smaller than in the past. Finally, given the prospect of growing dependence on OPEC oil, in the event of a major disruption the lessened responsiveness of demand to price increases could cause dramatic price increases and serious macroeconomic effects.\nCollapse", "694": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that the post-2004, across-the-board, commodity price increases, which initially appeared to be a spike similar to the ones experienced during the early 1950s (Korean War) and the 1970s (oil crises), have a more permanent character. From 1997-2004 to 2005-12 nominal prices of energy, fertilizers, and precious metals tripled, metal prices went up by more than 150 percent, and most food prices doubled. Such price increases, especially in food commodities, not only fueled a debate on their key causes, but also alarmed government officials, leading to calls for coordinated policy actions. This paper examines the relative contribution of various sector and macroeconomic drivers to price changes of five food commodities (maize, wheat, rice, soybeans, and palm oil) by applying a reduced-form econometric model on 1960-2012 annual data. The drivers include stock-to-use ratios, crude oil and manufacturing prices, the United States dollar exchange rate, interest rate, and income. Based on long-run elasticity estimates (approximately -0.25 for the stock-to-use ratios, 0.25 for the oil price, -1.25 for the exchange rate, and much less for others), the paper estimates the contribution of these drivers to food price increases from 1997-2004 to 2005-12. It concludes that most of the price increases are accounted for by crude oil prices (more than 50 percent), followed by stock-to-use ratios and exchange rate movements, which are estimated at about 15 percent each. Crude oil prices mattered most during the recent boom period because they experienced the largest increase.\nCollapse", "695": "Abstract Developing nations are faced with a two-edged sword in the field of energy. On the one hand the rising price of oil has reduced the potential for fossil fuel energy and eroded foreign exchange reserves in oil-importing countries.

This paper reviews the most recent and sometimes controversial estimates of deforestation in developing countries and analyzes the relationship between deforestation and its probable causes. Three recent estimates of the rate of deforestation in developing countries between 1968 and 1978 are compared using rank order correlation.

With asymmetric information about a country's expropriation cost, even optimal contracts feature expropriations. Near linearity in the oil price of real-world hydrocarbon contracts also helps to explain expropriations.

In this paper we derive relations among the biophysical characteristic of an energy resource in relation to the businesses and technologies that exploit them. These relations include the energy return on energy investment (EROI), the price of energy, and the profit of an energy business. Our analyses show that EROI and the price of energy are inherently inversely related such that as EROI decreases for depleting fossil fuel production, the corresponding energy prices increase dramatically. Using energy and financial data for the oil and gas production sector, we demonstrate that the equations sufficiently describe the fundamental trends between profit, price, and EROI. For example, in 2002 an EROI of 11:1 for US oil and gas translates to an oil price of 24 $2005/barrel at a typical profit of 10%. This work sets the stage for proper EROI and price comparisons of individual fossil and renewable energy businesses as well as the electricity sector as a whole.

Why do some countries spend so much money to subsidize petroleum consumption? Previous studies suggest that oil-rich autocracies lacking institutional capacity are the main culprits. However, they cannot explain why oil importers with capable bureaucracies, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Malaysia, subsidized petroleum products. We argue that governments in countries with national oil companies (NOCs) use petroleum subsidies to cushion the effects of increasing oil prices. Empirically, we examine the relationship between oil prices and domestic gasoline prices in 175 countries, 2002-2009. An NOC halves the effect of oil price increases on the domestic gasoline price. This effect is strongly associated with the institutional design of NOCs, as increased autonomy shields them from political interference by the government.\nCollapse", "714": "Since World War II, inflation--the apparently inexorable rise in the prices of goods and services--has been the bane of central bankers.

End-user prices in July 2012 varied by two orders of magnitude across the countries. More than two-fifths, including some that had only recently adopted automatic pricing mechanisms, froze the prices of gasoline, diesel, or both for months or even years on end during the study period. When the prices were finally adjusted, the increases were sometimes substantial, leading to large-scale protests, partial or full reversals of price adjustments, or softening of pricing reform policy. Governments' attempts to keep domestic prices artificially low -- through price control, export or quantity restrictions, or political pressure put on oil companies -- have helped curb inflation in the short term, but frequently with serious negative consequences: flourishing black markets, smuggling, fuel adulteration, illegal diversion of subsidy funds, large financial losses suffered by fuel suppliers, deteriorating refining and other infrastructure, and acute fuel shortages causing economy-wide damage. In several countries, subsidies, price controls, and other restrictions have helped protect inefficient refineries and oil marketers. Mitigation responses have included fuel conservation programs; fuel diversification, particularly liquid biofuels to substitute gasoline and diesel; and efforts to lower costs of supply, including strengthening infrastructure, promoting price competition, hedging, negotiating price discounts with exporters, and bulk procurement.

As the most massive transfer of wealth ever to occur without war began to work its way through the international system, wild predictions were made about the potential skyrocketing wealth of oil exporting countries.(1) While the industrialized countries trembled at the prospect that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) might become the world's most powerful banker, the oil exporters(2) were euphoric. Prosperity, in their view, would provide a sustainable base for a post-oil economy, full employment, national security and political stability; in short, it would permit oil-exporters to join the countries of the First World.

And we will look like you.\"(3) Such predictions have proved to be the modern version of the Midas myth. Twenty-five years after the 1970s boom, and despite two other major price hikes in the 1990s, most oil-exporting countries are in crisis, especially the capital-deficient ones.(4) Plagued by bottlenecks and breakdowns in production, capital flight, drastic declines in efficiency, double-digit inflation, overvalued currencies and budget deficits, they urgently seek the foreign capital and joint ventures that they so vehemently rejected during the nationalizations of oil in the 1970s. As their economic performance worsens and their oil and debt dependence increases to levels higher than in the pre-bonanza years, most oil exporters' political stability also has suffered. From Nigeria and Venezuela to Indonesia and Algeria, riots, conflict and outright civil war threaten the populations of OPEC countries. Just as gold once tainted King Midas' life despite his expectations to the contrary, oil seemed to \"petrolize\" the economy and polity of these countries. \"It is the devil's excrement,\" OPEC's founder, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, observed. \"We are drowning in the devil's excrement.\"(5) What I have elsewhere called \"the paradox of plenty\" poses a significant puzzle for both scholars and policymakers.(6) That oil-rich countries--countries as dissimilar as Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria, Algeria and Indonesia--should end up in profound economic and political crisis is remarkable. That they also stand at strikingly similar junctures despite all their differences calls for an explanation. These countries are heterogeneous in virtually every respect except oil: they are physically diverse (Algeria is more than 100 times larger than tiny Kuwait) and demographically different (Indonesia's population is 132 times that of Qatar); they vary in their oil reserves (Saudi Arabia has 265 times as much as Gabon), not to mention their other factor endowments. Their standards of living showed enormous discrepancies at the time of the 1974 boom, with per capita income as low as $170 in Indonesia compared with $11,000 in the United Arab Emirates, and their political regimes ranged from democracy (Venezuela and Ecuador) to military rule (Iraq and often Nigeria), from strict Islamic theocracies (Saudi Arabia and post-1979 Iran) to nominally socialist one-party systems (Algeria). There are profound differences between Nigeria, which falls at the worst end of the continuum, and Indonesia, which has fared better.(7) That is not to argue that oil countries are worse off than many of their non-oil counterparts, which may or may not be the case depending on the comparisons involved.

Even though we are no longer faced with sky-high oil prices, the issues discussed here remain important and policy relevant. It is hard to believe that oil prices will not go up again sometime in the future, so it is vital that we learn from the last episode, both about how the economy is likely to be affected and how monetary policy should respond. Perhaps not surprisingly, most of my discussion relates to the latter topic, namely the Fed\u2019s policy response to the swings in oil prices over the last seven years. But I would like to start by commenting on the paper\u2019s discussion of the relationship between the market price of oil and the value of oil in the ground. Thinking of this relationship in terms of Tobin\u2019s q is an elegant and insightful contribution. As the authors point out, oil in the ground is like any other irreproducible asset, which should be described by Hotelling\u2019s theory that the price of such an asset minus marginal cost increases at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate. But oil above the ground has distinct characteristics. And a number of factors can cause its price to depart\u2014 for some time\u2014from the value implied by Hotelling\u2019s model.

Hence the model imposes restrictions on the joint dynamics of spot and futures prices, which I test for four commodities.

Because of oil supply shocks and seasonal movements in gasoline demand, retail gasoline prices often fluctuate more widely than consumer prices in general. Some analysts and politicians have criticized these retail gasoline price movements, alleging that they do not respond symmetrically to price changes at earlier stages of the marketing chain. In particular, they believe that retail gasoline prices do not reflect decreases in oil and wholesale gasoline prices as rapidly and fully as they do price increases.

The perceived asymmetry in retail gasoline price movements is of special concern to consumers who believe that they are being \u201cgouged\u201d by the oil industry.

I employ a simulation model to compare OPEC s payoffs from faster or slower output growth, under various parametric assumptions about the responsiveness of world oil demand and Non-OPEC supply to income and price changes. The payoffs to OPEC are relatively insensitive to faster output growth; aggressive output expansion yields slightly lower payoffs than just maintaining current market share. Analysis of intra-OPEC decisions between the Core countries and the others suggests a similar conclusion: these two groups are engaged in a constant-sum game. Thus, the significant increases in OPEC output projected by IEA and DOE are implausible.\nCollapse", "750": "The paper studies the dynamic interactions among indicators of economic activity, such as industrial production, interest rate and exchange rate, the performance of the foreign stock market, oil prices, and stock returns to examine whether economic activity movements affect the performance of the stock market for Greece.

In our model production of the consumption good requires two inputs: the consumption good and a commodity, e.g., Oil. Oil is produced by wells whose flow rate is costly to adjust. Investment in new Oil wells is costly and irreversible. As a result in equilibrium, investment in Oil wells is infrequent and lumpy. Even though the state of the economy is fully described by a one-factor Markov process, the spot oil price is not Markov (in itself). Rather it is best described as a regime-switching process, the regime being an investment `proximity' indicator. The resulting equilibrium oil price exhibits mean-reversion and heteroscedasticity. Further, the risk premium for exposure to commodity risk is time-varying, positive in the far-from-investment regime but negative in the near-investment regime. Further, our model captures many of the stylized facts of oil futures prices, such as backwardation and the `Samuelson effect.' The futures curve exhibits backwardation as a result of a convenience yield, which arises endogenously. We estimate our model using the Simulated Method of Moments with economic aggregate data and crude oil futures prices. The model successfully captures the first two moments of the futures curves, the average non-durable consumption-output ratio, the average oil consumption-output and the average real interest rate. The estimation results suggest the presence of convex adjustment costs for the investment in new oil wells.

Were they engineered by an effective cartel of OPEC members acting to share the market by controlling output and influencing market prices? If OPEC was an effective cartel sharing the market among its members, there would be a long-run relationship between each member's individual production and total OPEC output. One would also expect OPEC's production to significantly affect the market price of oil as the organization is often accused of curbing production in order to raise prices. These implications of cartel behavior are tested via cointegration and causality tests. The likely effects of regime changes are dealt with using techniques developed by Perron (1989). There is evidence of output coordination among some members of the organization, especially in the output rationing era (1982-93). This is also the only period in which the causality from OPEC production to the price of oil is statistically significant. Overall, the evidence suggests that OPEC did act as a cartel in the 1980's in order to maintain prices, while it simply took advantage of market conditions in the 1970's and did not have to restrain output.\nCollapse", "755": "At the start of 1994 Metallgesellschaft AG, the 14th largest corporation in Germany, stood on the brink of bankruptcy as a result of more than $1 billion in losses from trading in oil futures.

How could a set of transactions which purportedly locked-in profits, making the firm safer, in fact lead the firm to bankruptcy? A critical problem was the mismatch in maturities between the company's delivery contract exposure to oil price risk and the company's portfolio of futures. Although the contract exposure was to long-term oil prices, it hedged with short- dated futures in order to capture profits from perceived mispricings in that market.

These relative price movements have had important implications for inflation and economic activity in both Canada and the rest of the world. China has accounted for the bulk of incremental demand for oil and many base metals over this period. As rapid economic growth in China has raised the level of world demand, this has put upward pressure on commodity prices. The effect has been amplified by rising resource intensities in China's production in recent years. This paper discusses the factors driving emerging Asia's demand for commodities and assesses the impact of emerging Asia on the real prices of oil and base metals in the Bank of Canada Commodity Price Index (BCPI). Two separate single-equation models are estimated for oil and the base metals price index. We employ a structural break approach for oil prices, while metals prices are modelled with an error correction model (ECM). In both cases, we find strong evidence that oil and metals prices have historically moved with the business cycle in the developed world, but that this relationship has broken down since mid-1997. Thereafter, industrial activity in emerging Asia appears to have become a more dominant driver of oil price movements. While metal price fluctuations have also become increasingly aligned with levels of industrial activity in emerging Asia, rising intensities of metal production may have been a more important factor behind the acceleration in prices in recent years.\nCollapse", "764": "This paper empirically examines whether major domestic oil companies held down product prices relative to their less visible counterparts during the 1979 oil crisis.

Nanotechnology has the potential to profoundly change enhanced oil recovery and to improve mechanism of recovery. This paper, therefore, focuses on the reviews of the application of nano technology in chemical flooding process in oil recovery and reviews the application nano in the polymer and surfactant flooding on the interfacial tension process.\nCollapse", "785": "Countries that are rich in petroleum have less democracy, less economic stability, and more frequent civil wars than countries without oil. What explains this oil curse? And can it be fixed? In this groundbreaking analysis, Michael L. Ross looks at how developing nations are shaped by their mineral wealth--and how they can turn oil from a curse into a blessing. Ross traces the oil curse to the upheaval of the 1970s, when oil prices soared and governments across the developing world seized control of their countries' oil industries. Before nationalization, the oil-rich countries looked much like the rest of the world; today, they are 50 percent more likely to be ruled by autocrats--and twice as likely to descend into civil war--than countries without oil. The Oil Curse shows why oil wealth typically creates less economic growth than it should; why it produces jobs for men but not women; and why it creates more problems in poor states than in rich ones. It also warns that the global thirst for petroleum is causing companies to drill in increasingly poor nations, which could further spread the oil curse.\nCollapse", "786": "ABSTRACT This article investigates the causal impact of oil prices on stock prices in each G7 market as well as in the world market. An asymmetric causality test developed by Hatemi-J is used for this purpose. Since the underlying data appears to be non-normal with time-varying volatility, we use bootstrap simulations with leverage adjustments in order to produce more reliable critical values than the asymptotic ones. Based on symmetric causality tests, we find no causal effect of oil prices on the stock prices of the world market or any of the G7 countries. However, when we apply an asymmetric causality test, we find that increasing oil prices cause stock prices to rise in the world, the U.S. and Japan while decreasing oil prices cause stock prices to fall in Germany. This may imply that the world, the U.S. and Japanese stock markets consider increases in oil prices as an indicator of good news as this may mean that there is an increase in oil demand due to an expected growth in the economy while the German stock market treats decreasing oil prices as a signal of an expected contraction in the economy.\nCollapse", "790": "ABSTRACT This study scrutinized the asymmetric impact of oil prices, exchange rate, and inflation on tourism demand in Pakistan using [Shin, Y., Yu, B., & Greenwood-Nimmo, M.

The NARDL bounds test examined the existence of cointegration in study variables, including CO2 emissions, institutional quality, oil prices, exchange rate, inflation, and tourism demand.

The estimated NARDL model affirmed long-run negative and significant effect of CO2 emissions on tourism demand, while institutional quality was positively associated with tourism demand. Furthermore, the findings of the study also suggested long-run asymmetric relationship between oil prices, exchange rate, inflation, and tourism demand.\nCollapse", "791": "Abstract Ignored structural breaks in a VAR result in a misspecified model such that Granger causality tests are improperly sized; there is a bias towards a rejection of the null hypothesis of non-causality even when the null is correct. Instead of modeling structural breaks as being sharp, changes in the relationship between the maize and petroleum markets are likely to have occurred gradually.

When applied to a VAR including maize and oil prices, we uncover important linkages between the two markets.\nCollapse", "792": "This paper investigates the global macroeconomic consequences of country-specific oil-supply shocks. Our contribution is both theoretical and empirical. On the theoretical side, we develop a model for the global oil market and integrate this within a compact quarterly model of the global economy to illustrate how our multi-country approach to modelling oil markets can be used to identify country-specific oil-supply shocks. On the empirical side, estimating the GVAR-Oil model for 27 countries/regions over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, we show that the global economic implications of oil-supply shocks (due to, for instance, sanctions, wars, or natural disasters) vary considerably depending on which country is subject to the shock. In particular, we find that adverse shocks to Iranian oil output are neutralized in terms of their effects on the global economy (real outputs and financial markets) mainly due to an increase in Saudi Arabian oil production. In contrast, a negative shock to oil supply in Saudi Arabia leads to an immediate and permanent increase in oil prices, given that the loss in Saudi Arabian production is not compensated for by the other oil producers. As a result, a Saudi Arabian oil supply shock has significant adverse effects for the global economy with real GDP falling in both advanced and emerging economies, and large losses in real equity prices worldwide.\nCollapse", "800": "AbstractChemical flooding is of increasing interest and importance due to high oil prices and the need to increase oil production. Research in nanotechnology in the petroleum industry is advancing rapidly, and an enormous progress in the application of nanotechnology in this area is to be expected.

This paper therefore focuses on the reviews of the application of nanotechnology in chemical flooding process in oil recovery and reviews the applications of nanomaterials for improving oil recovery that have been proposed to explain oil displacement by polymer flooding within oil reservoirs, and also this paper highlights the research advances of polymer in oil recovery.

Specifically, we allow the cointegrating equation to switch between m states, according to a first-order Markov process. First, we find evidence that regime-switching exists in the relative pricing relationship, and that two is the optimal number of states. Once we control for shifts in the cointegrating vector, we find that natural gas and crude oil prices are cointegrated, and an error correction model (ECM) of their long-term equilibrium relationship is properly specified. This finding broadens the ECM model of their relationship to longer and more varied sample periods. Also, in a direct comparison of the two and one state cointegrating equations, we found evidence of the potential superiority of the two-state equation, in that it may be robust to shifts in the cointegrating vector which are missed by standard tests for a unit root. Further, our analysis finds evidence that natural gas and crude oil prices did not permanently \u2018decouple\u2019 in the early 2000s, but rather experienced a temporary shift in regimes. We find that forecasts of the relative pricing of natural gas and crude oil should be conditioned on state probability.\nCollapse", "802": "This paper takes a financial market perspective in examining the relationship between oil prices, the US dollar and asset prices, and it exploits the heteroskedasticity for the identification of causality in a multifactor model. It finds a bidirectional causality between the US dollar and oil prices since the early 2000s. Moreover, both oil prices and the US dollar are significantly affected by changes in equity market returns and risk. By contrast, oil prices did not react to changes in these financial assets before 2001. The paper provides evidence that this may be explained by the increased use of oil as a financial asset over the past decade, which intensified the link between oil and other assets. The model can account well for the strong and rising negative correlation between oil prices and the US dollar since the early 2000s, with risk shocks and the financialisation process of oil prices explaining most of the strengthening of this correlation.\nCollapse", "810": "This article investigates the potential of nonlinear causal relationships between world oil prices and stock markets in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries during a black swan period that is characterized by rarity and devastating impacts.

By using the nonlinear and asymmetric causality test of Kyrtsou and Labys (2006), we mainly find that: (i) the oil prices and MENA stock markets interact in a nonlinear manner; (ii) the signs of changes in the causing variables are important for detecting the true causality links between the variables and (iii) the nonlinear causality is more pronounced in the case of the Brent than West Texas Intermediate oil prices.\nCollapse", "811": "type=\"main\"> We introduce a novel approach to estimating latent oil risk factors and establish their significance in pricing nonoil securities.

These results indicate that oil prices respond very rapidly to new economic data in ways that appear consistent with economic theory, and they suggest that economic news, rather than speculation unrelated to the economic environment, drives jumps in oil prices.\nCollapse", "823": "This paper investigates the long run relationship between oil prices and stock prices for India over the period April 2000June 2011.

The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) test was performed to determine the impact of oil prices on nominal exchange rate using monthly time series data covering the period between 1994 and 2012. The results show that oil prices have a significant impact on nominal exchange rates. In addition, the findings reveal that an increase in oil prices leads to a depreciation of the rand exchange rate. This implies that oil prices are a very important variable in determining the strength of the currency and its volatility. The South African government should consider the impacts of oil prices when formulating and implementing economic policies especially the exchange rate policies.\nCollapse", "831": "Crude oil development and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery, the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore, combined with artificial lift techniques (such as pumps) which bring the oil to the surface. But only about 10 per cent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery. Secondary recovery techniques to the field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 per cent of the original oil in place. In the past two decades, major oil companies and research organizations have conducted extensive theoretical and laboratory EOR (enhanced oil recovery) researches, to include validating pilot and field trials relevant to much needed domestic commercial application, while western countries had terminated such endeavours almost completely due to low oil prices. In recent years, oil demand has soared and now these operations have become more desirable. This book is about the recent developments in the area as well as the technology for enhancing oil recovery. The book provides important case studies related to over one hundred EOR pilot and field applications in a variety of oil fields. These case studies focus on practical problems, underlying theoretical and modelling methods, operational parameters (e.g., injected chemical concentration, slug sizes, flooding schemes and well spacing), solutions and sensitivity studies, and performance optimization strategies. The book strikes an ideal balance between theory and practice, and would be invaluable to academicians and oil company practitioners alike. The following are the features of the book: Updated chemical EOR fundamentals - this book provides clear picture of fundamental concepts. Practical cases with problems and solutions - this title provides practical analogues and experiences.

This paper proposes and estimates a structural vector autoregression model to investigate the dynamic relationship between these variables. Impulse responses are calculated in two ways (standard and projection based methods). The model supports stylized facts. In particular, positive shocks to oil prices tend to depress emerging market stock prices and US dollar exchange rates in the short run. The model also captures stylized facts regarding movements in oil prices. A positive oil production shock lowers oil prices while a positive shock to real economic activity increases oil prices. There is also evidence that increases in emerging market stock prices increases oil prices.\nCollapse", "840": "The authors test whether the reaction of international stock markets to oil shocks can be justified by current and future changes in real cash flows and/or changes in expected returns.

Under the assumptions of exogenous oil prices and world oil demand, we are able to describe the relationship between oil production levels and changes in the conditions in world oil markets. Intertemporal production decisions by a representative oil producer are modelled by means of a partial equilibrium model. In this theoretical model, oil producers are subject to exogenous shocks in world oil demand and prices. Oil companies can change output levels only by incurring a fixed cost. Results from the simulation of this model show a strong relationship between oil production and changes in world oil consumption. On the contrary, the effects of changes in real oil prices on oil production decisions seem to be much lower. Results from the simulation of the theoretical model are then empirically investigated using time-series econometric techniques. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that several oil producing countries are characterized by different responses to changes in world oil demand and in real oil prices. For many countries production rapidly adjusts to changes in consumption whereas responses of oil production to innovations in real oil prices are found to be not statistically significant. In addition, when non-linearities in the relationship between exogenous variables and output levels are allowed for, evidence of asymmetric effects of output levels to shocks in demand levels and oil prices is found.\nCollapse", "852": "This paper documents the existence of a significant forecast error on crude oil futures, particularly evident since the mid-1990s, which is negative on average and displays a non-trivial cyclical component (risk premium).

This paper estimates the impact of higher international oil prices on the Indonesian government's fiscal position in 2008 and beyond. It analyzes the interactions between government revenues and expenditures, as well as international oil prices, energy subsidies, and inter-governmental transfers. Looking at the impact of oil prices over US$100 per barrel, the paper presents five main findings. First, despite record high oil prices, the government's oil and gas revenues have been decreasing relative to non-oil and gas revenues since 2001. Second, fuel subsides will reach record levels in 2008 while electricity subsidies have been increasing even faster. Third, the paper finds that most of the fuel subsidy that directly benefits households goes to the richest 20 percent. Fourth, even at levels above US$100 per barrel, the government receives more revenues from oil and gas than it spends on energy subsidies. However, due to significant revenue-sharing with sub-national governments, high oil prices are net-negative for the central government, while they create fiscal windfalls for many regions. Finally, the oil sector's positive impact on Indonesia's public finances declines as oil prices rise, because subsidies and other expenditures outgrow oil and gas revenues.\nCollapse", "892": "Is there a way to lower oil prices?

To the extent that conservation or fuel-diversification reduces dependence on any one source, the financial and strategic risk of potential disruption in supply or spike in cost of that source is reduced. This reduction in risks improves energy security. Reduced oil imports would also provide sustained benefits over the long run even in undisrupted markets, by reducing global demand pressure and oil prices during what is expected to be an extended period of strong global demand growth, substantial OPEC market power and higher world oil prices. We consider projected oil market conditions over the next ten years, relying on official U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections. A current estimate of the oil import premium is $12.00 per barrel (in 2005 dollars), with a wide confidence interval ($6.67 $17.95) to reflect many of the unresolved uncertainties. While this central value is above some estimates from the mid-1990s and early 2000s, it is well within the range of prior estimates up to 1993, many of which were made at times when oil market conditions were more similar to what is now anticipated. The essential message is that we may have passed through a brief period of comparatively greater energy security and lower dependence costs, but strong market and geopolitical forces have returned the societal costs of oil imports to greater prominence. An important note is that this premium estimate omits any costs for military programs, and the difficult-to-quantify foreign policy impact of oil import reliance.\nCollapse", "894": "This book reviews the challenges that face industrialized societies as they cope with growing dependence on transport fueled by low-priced oil. The authors caution that the shortfall between expected demand for and supply of world oil production could result in extremely high oil prices; catastrophic climate change offers another issue of contention. The book begins with an exploration of past transport revolutions, to gain insight into the nature and dynamics of profound change. Then the authors describe how the high oil prices in particular could give rise to two or more revolutions in land transport during the first half of the 21st century: the replacement of internal combustion engines by electric motors and the widespread powering of these motors directly from the electric grid rather than from on-board fuel. These transformations would allow considerable movement of people and freight by land in an era of severe energy constraints and concerns about carbon emissions. The authors include marine transportation and aviation in their commentary. Topics include current transport, with a focus on energy use and adverse impacts; the politics and business of transport; and organizational and technical innovations that could ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that minimize environmental impacts and make the best use of renewable sources of energy.

However, the literature on the contribution is small, tends to focus narrowly on their fiscal benefits, and concludes that they are redundant of such funds - in other words, that well designed fiscal management and policy are adequate substitutes for oil funds. This paper argues that a broader focus is needed in judging the effectiveness of such funds. We test whether oil funds help reduce macroeconomic volatility. The econometric estimation results from a 30-year panel data set of 15 countries with and without oil funds suggest that oil funds are associated with reduced volatility of broad money and prices and lower inflation. However, there is a statistically weak negative association between the presence of an oil fund and volatility of the real exchange rate.\nCollapse", "904": "The first few months of 2008 saw crude oil prices breach one barrier after another. They topped $100 a barrel for the first time on Feb. 19, then rose past $103.76 about two weeks later, surpassing the previous inflation-adjusted peak, established in 1980. In April and early May, oil prices pushed past $110 and then $120 a barrel and beyond. ; These milestones reflect a new era in oil markets. After the tumult of the early 1980s, prices remained relatively tame for two decades - in both real and nominal terms. This long stretch of stability ended in 2004, when oil topped $40 a barrel for the first time, then embarked on a steep climb that continued into this year. ; Modern economies run on oil, so it's important to understand how recent years - with their surging prices - differ from the preceding two decades. A good starting point is strong demand, which has pushed world oil markets close to capacity. New supplies haven't kept up with this demand, fueling expectations that oil markets will remain tight for the foreseeable future. A weakening dollar has put upward pressure on the price of a commodity that trades in the U.S. currency. And because a large share of oil production takes place in politically unstable regions, fears of supply disruptions loom over markets. ; These factors have fed the steady, sometimes swift rise of oil prices in recent years. Their persistence suggests the days of relatively cheap oil are over and the global economy faces a future of high energy prices.

Commodity export price uncertainty is typically measured as the standard deviation in the terms of trade. There are three problems with this approach: 1) Terms of trade indices are unsuitable as proxies for commodity price movements per se. 2) The shortness of terms of trade time series makes them inappropriate as a base for constructing time-varying uncertainty measures. 3) Simple standard deviation measures ignore the distinction between predictable and unpredictable elements in the price process, so they risk overstating uncertainty. 4) The author examines commodity price uncertainty in developing countries using new data for quarterly aggregate commodity price indices for 113 developing countries for the period 1957-97. Each index is a geometrically weighted index of 57 commodity prices. He constructs six different measures of uncertainty. The uncertainty measures confirm the importance of distinguishing between predictable and unpredictable components in the price process. But there is a positive, highly significant relationship between commodity export concentration and commodity price uncertainty for all six measures. No obvious link is found between a country's regional affiliation and its exposure to uncertainty. Sub-Saharan African countries, for example, are no more prone to commodity price uncertainty than countries in other commodity-producing regions, although to the extent that they depend more on commodities, they will be affected more than countries with more diversified export baskets. Similarly, there is no apparent relationship between a country's experiences of uncertainty and the type of commodities that dominate its exports-except that oil producers face greater uncertainty (because of discrete, well-publicized oil shocks). A measure of uncertainty based on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) indicates considerable time variation in uncertainty. Uncertainty is sometimes characterized by discrete spikes, although uncertainty in countries exhibits a secular increase over time. Most countries experience uncertainty, which tends to persist. It is unclear what lies behind the time variation in uncertainty.\nCollapse", "914": "This article examines the relationship between the spot and futures prices of WTI crude oil using a sample of daily data.

WEO-2008 draws on the experience of another turbulent year in energy markets to provide new energy projections to 2030, region by region and fuel by fuel. It incorporates the latest data and policies. WEO-2008 focuses on two pressing issues facing the energy sector today: (1) Prospects for oil and gas production: How much oil and gas exists and how much can be produced? Will investment be adequate? Through field-by-field analysis of production trends at 800 of the world's largest oilfields, an assessment of the potential for finding and developing new reserves and a bottom-up analysis of upstream costs and investment, WEO-2008 takes a hard look at future global oil and gas supply. (2) Post-2012 climate scenarios: What emissions limits might emerge from current international negotiations on climate change? What role could cap-and-trade and sectoral approaches play in moving to a low-carbon energy future? Two different scenarios are assessed, one in which the atmospheric concentration of emissions is stabilised at 550 parts per million (ppm) in CO2 equivalent terms and the second at the still more ambitious level of 450ppm. The implications for energy demand, prices, investment, air pollution and energy security are fully spelt out. This ground-breaking analysis will enable policy makers to distill the key choices as they strive to agree in Copenhagen in 2009 on a post-Kyoto climate framework.

The research period covered is 1995:Q1 - 2001:Q3. The results indicate that in the long run a 10% permanent increase (decrease) in international oil prices is associated with a 2.2% growth (fall) in the level of Russian GDP.

These long-run equilibrium relationships also have a significant impact on short-run dynamics through an error-correction mechanism.

Now, 25 years later, he has written the fascinating history of the greatest monopoly ever known. The underlying economic analysis is contained in the companion volume The Economics of Petroleum Supply. Pictures of oil as the glittering prize, the source of global power and empires, or the hub of an energy crisis have gushed through the media since 1973. What actually happened was very different. M. A. Adelman had written in 1970 that \"the genie is out of the bottle,\" that a group of oil producing countries would control the oil trade to raise prices. Now, twenty-five years later, he has written the fascinating history of the greatest monopoly ever known. The underlying economic analysis is contained in the companion volume The Economics of Petroleum Supply. Oil was in oversupply in 1970. The oil companies could not keep prices from falling. But the members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) could and did raise prices by restraining output. However, they first had to restrain each other: an endless task, since each of them would gain by cheating on the others. With open and secret agreements, formal and informal, they \"tried to fine-tune with coarse instruments,\" resulting in the so-called energy crisis. Adelman describes the first timid steps to the \"unbound cartel.\" He shows how the producing nations overestimated their power, why they had short time horizons and raised the prices too high for their own good. But after prices declined, then crashed in 1986, the producing nations managed to hold a lower price level. Despite the trillions of petrodollars that fed two major wars, Adelman observes that nearly all OPEC nations are in debt. Non-OPEC production grows, but the cartel survives and the unstable market with it. Price hawks and doves may be good copy, Adelman notes, but in fact there was never an Arab \"embargo\" against the United States, nor any moderating influence by the United States.

This hypothesis of Weiner is kept unchanged. However, we are more interested in the efficiency implications of a regionalized world oil market than its policy implications as discussed by Weiner. Specifically, if these prices deviate from each other, i.e., the market is fragmented, there will be arbitrage opportunities for crude oil traders which would render the market inefficient. In this paper, the regionalization hypothesis is investigated via cointegration tests using both spot and contract prices for fifteen crude oils. Three groups of similar quality crudes are formed based on API gravity and sulfur content. Tests of cross-group co-movement which provided evidence for significant quality differences between heavy and light crudes further supported our groupings. Then the co-movement of prices is tested within each group. The crash in 1986 is explicitly dealt with following methods described in Perron (1989). Results indicate that the world crude oil market is unified over the 1980-95 period.\nCollapse", "934": "The aim of this paper is to analyse the implications of the theory of irreversible investment under uncertainty for investment in oil fields on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS). We consider the problem of an operator who owns a licence to develop and extract oil from a field of known capacity. An intertemporal optimization model in discrete time is developed to derive decision rules for the timing of the irreversible development investment and for the optimal rate of extraction. Model simulation is then used to describe the properties of the numerical solutions. The predictions of the theory on the determinants of the irreversible investment decision are then examined using statistical duration analysis. Data on the length of the time period between discovery and development are available for individual fields on the UKCS. We measure the duration of the irreversible investment gestation lag for each field and test the model by assessing the significance of the theoretical variables in explaining the significance of such a lag. Both our theoretical model and our empirical results suggest the importance of a nonlinear interaction of the level of oil prices and the volatility of oil prices in determining the development lag. The simulation of our theoretical model shows a nonlinear impact of oil price volatility on the trigger level of oil prices. Our empirical results suggest that the effect of price volatility is a function of the expected price level, with increased price volatility having a positive impact on the duration of investment appraisal when expected prices are low and a negative impact when they are high.\nCollapse", "940": "In this paper, we establish an empirical model for oil production in the lower 48 states that represents its economic, physical, and institutional determinants. We estimate a vector error correction model for oil production in the lower 48 states that specifies real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing by the Texas Railroad Commission. These modifications enable us to generate a model that accounts for most of the variation in oil production in the lower 48 states between 1938 and 1991. The result that oil production in the lower 48 states shares stochastic trends with real oil prices, average production costs, and prorationing indicates that accuracy of Hubbert's bell shaped curve is fortuitous. The importance of these factors also indicates why the basic Hotelling model cannot replicate the production path for oil in the lower 48 states. This inability is critical. The negative economic effects associated with high prices and energy shortages imply that the importance of inconsistencies with the basic Hotelling model identified by this analysis may be sufficient to warrant a greater degree of government intervention in the transition from oil than is currently envisioned by most policy makers.\nCollapse", "941": "The 1980 report of the Brandt Commission, calling for \"a global agreement ... between oil producing and consuming countries\" to assure adequate production at reasonable prices, states the gist of innumerable reports, articles, speeches, and resolutions, urging cooperation, dialogue, and interdependence.\nCollapse", "942": "Oil-producing countries face challenges arising from the fact that oil revenue is exhaustible, volatile, and uncertain, and largely originates from abroad.

Our objective was to cool the heated rhetoric in the food-versus-fuel debate, which had been rising right along with the prices of corn and oil. Today, although the rhetoric seems to be lower, prices of oil and commodities, including corn, soybeans and wheat, have again approached the levels of 2008. In addition, policy makers today are focused on a national debate over fiscal policy\u2014a debate that encompasses the future direction of food, agricultural and energy policies. Farm Foundation commissioned the current paper to provide a comprehensive, objective assessment of the forces driving commodity and food prices. A major question was whether the forces at work today are the same as or different from those of 2008. Our goal is to provide public and private decision makers with an objective assessment of the forces driving commodity prices, as well as offer some insights into the impacts on policy options. Now, as in 2008, the full story behind rapid increases in commodity prices is not a simple one. Many of the factors driving prices remain the same but play out in different ways\u2014including biofuel demands, exchange rates and weather. As concluded in 2008, one simple fact stands out: economic growth and rising human aspirations are putting ever greater pressure on the global resource base.

Cost estimation is carried out with the aid of ICARUS software. Further economic analysis is performed to determine profitability of the algal oil to biodiesel process. The results suggest that, for the algal oil to biodiesel process analyzed in this study, factors such as choosing the right algal species, using the appropriate pathway for converting algae to algal oil, selling the resulting biodiesel and glycerol at a favorable market selling prices, and attaining high levels of process integration can collectively render algal oil to be a competitive alternative to food-based plant oils.\nCollapse", "991": "A new generation of lithium-ion batteries, coupled with rising oil prices and the need to address climate change, has sparked a global race to electrify transportation.

The results of a robust multivariate long-run dynamic analysis reveal the presence of four highly integrated central European markets (France, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria). The trend shared by these four electricity markets appears to be common also to gas prices, but not to oil prices. The existence of a common long-term dynamics among electricity prices and between electricity prices and gas prices can be explained by the similarity of the market design across Europe and by the same marginal generation technology. Since standard unit root and cointegration tests are not robust to the peculiar characteristics of electricity prices time series, we also develop a battery of robust inference procedures that should assure the reliability of our results.

Farm Foundation is not about heat or fueling fires. Our mission is to be a catalyst for sound public policy by providing objective information to foster deeper understanding of the complex issues before the food system today. We commissioned Purdue University economists Wallace Tyner, Philip Abbott and Christopher Hurt to provide a comprehensive, objective assessment of the forces driving food prices. Released in July 2008, What\u2019s Driving Food Prices? identified three major drivers of prices\u2014depreciation of the U.S. dollar, changes in production and consumption, and growth in biofuels production. The three economists also reviewed more than two dozen reports and studies in the academic and popular press about commodity prices, biofuels and food prices, summarizing them in light of their own examination of the facts. Today, just eight months later, the landscape is remarkably different. The 2008/2009 crop production was higher than forecast, quieting talk of inadequate supplies. Significant declines have occurred in crude oil, grain and oilseed crop prices. Biofuel production has slowed. The value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated. A global financial crisis and recession now dominate the news. Given this remarkable reversal of conditions, we asked Tyner, Abbott and Hurt to reexamine the drivers of food prices. Their analysis indicates that now, as eight months ago, the answers are not simple. While the level of food prices has dropped, the forces driving those prices remain the same today as in July 2008, as does the need to understand how those forces work and interact. As did the July 2008 report, this update reinforces the fact that food prices are influenced by diverse and multiple factors generated by complex global economic issues. It is the intent of Farm Foundation that the objective information provided in this report will help public and private leaders better understand the functions of these driving forces as they make business and public policy decisions for the future.\nCollapse", "1002": "instead of less in wages after the rise in oil prices from I973.

The relationship between changes in exchange rates and changes in import and export prices, known as the \"pass-through\" relationship, has been relatively stable historically. But recent changes in the pattern of U.S. trade, the unprecedented appreciation of the dollar during the first half of the 1980s, and the volatility of bilateral exchange rates may affect at least the speed of the passthrough of exchange rate changes to import and export prices, and possibly the long-run relationship as well. The top panel of chart 1 shows the significant movements over the last nine years of the foreign exchange value of the dollar measured in terms of a multilateral trade-weighted index of the currencies of the other Group of 10 countries. The bottom panel shows the actual unit value of non-oil imports and an estimate of that unit value based on a long-run historical relationship between exchange rates and import prices. The historical relationship suggests that non-oil import prices should have risen faster during 1985 than they did. This raises several questions: Are the profit margins of foreign suppliers being squeezed in the short-run? Is the long-run pass-through relationship changing?\nCollapse", "1004": "Abstract In 1973 the oil crisis prompted considerable world interest in the production of synfuels which, as a result, led to the development of the Mobil Methanol to Gasoline Process [1] and more recently to the Shell Middle Distillate Process [2]. Synfuels have been a subject of both scientific and political interest for most of the 20th century. With the recent Gulf crisis, which has resulted in a surge in crude oil prices, it is clear that the search to find economic alternatives to the use of petroleum as an energy source will continue. This observation is based on the fact that the world reserves of coal and natural gas far exceed those of oil, and this fact alone implies that the conversion of coal and natural gas to transportation fuels is almost certain to become more widespread within the next 20 years.\nCollapse", "1005": "We think of the expected real interest rate for ten OECD countries (our counterpart of the world economy) as determined by the equation of aggregate investment demand to aggregate desired saving. Stock-market returns isolate shifts to investment demand, and changes in oil prices, monetary growth, and fiscal variables isolate shifts to desired saving. In this paper, we estimated the reduced form for GDP-weighted world averages of the expected short-term real interest rate and the investment ratio over the period 1959-88. The estimates reveal significant effects in the predicted direction for world stock returns, oil prices, and world monetary growth, but fiscal variables trurned out to be unimportant. Structural estimation implies that an increase by 1% in the expected real interest rates raises the desired saving rate by one-third of a percentage point. Simulations of the model indicate that fluctuations in world stock returns and oil prices explain a good deal of the time series for the world average of expected real interest rates, specifically, why the rates were low in 1974-79 and high in 1981-86. The model also explains the fall in real rates in 1987-88 and the subsequent upturn in 1989. The fitted relation forecasts an increase in the world average of real interest rates in 1990 to a value, 5.6%, that is nearly a full percentage point above the highest value attained in the entire prior sample, 1958-89. We estimated systems of equations for individual countries' expected real interest rates and investment ratios. One finding is that each country's expected real interest rate depends primarily on world factors, rather than own-country factors, thereby suggesting a good deal of integration of world capital and goods markets.\nCollapse", "1006": "A new modelling strategy is introduced which provides a practical approach to incorporating long-run structural relationships, suggested by economic theory, in an otherwise unrestricted VAR model. The strategy is applied in the construction of a small quarterly macroeconometric model of the UK, estimated over the period 1965-1995 in eight core variables: domestic and foreign outputs, domestic and foreign prices (both measured relative to oil prices), the nominal effective exchange rate, nominal domestic and foreign interest rates and real money balances.

The results indicate that the empirical link between commodity prices and inflation has changed dramatically over time. Commodity prices were relatively strong and statistically robust leading indicators of overall inflation during the 1970s and early 1980s, but they have been poor stand-alone indicators of inflation since the early 1980s. When considered in conjunction with other likely indicators of inflation, non-oil commodity prices have had a somewhat more statistically robust relationship with inflation in recent years, though the added information content in commodity prices regarding inflation is limited.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)\nCollapse", "1013": "This article investigates the long\u2010term pricing relationship among crude oil, unleaded gasoline, and heating oil futures prices, and finds that these commodities futures prices are cointegrated.

This paper presents the fiit systematic empirical analysis of transfer prices, using data from the petroleum industry. On the basis of oil imported into the United States over the period 1973 - 1984, we test two propositions: i) Are prices set by integrated companies for their internal transfers different from those prevailing in arm 's-length (i.e., inter-company) trade, when other variables, such as oil quality, are controlled for? ii) Do average effective corporate income tar rates explain observed patterns of transfer pricing? Regression analysis leads to the following conclusions: i) Transfer and arm's-length prices differ significantly for oil origznating in some countries but not all. When multiplied by the relevant import volumes, these differences are relatively smalL The revenue transferred through deviations from arm's-length prices represents two percent or less of the value of the crude oil imported by multinational companies each year. ii) The observed differences between arm's-length and transfer prices are not easily explained by average effective tax rates in exporting countries. Our results provide little support for the claim that multinational petroleum companies set their transfer prices to evade taxes.

The view that I have come to is that undue addiction to simple neoclassical models is not an important constraint in policymaking today. It is true that the lack of relevant theory is a major constraint in assessing the \"structure\" of agriculture and regulatory and pricing issues in marketing. But this is not to say that the beginning of wisdom is to jettison the supplytdemand models that work best in analyzing farm commodity markets once we move past the farm gate. Constraints on the Modeling of Agriclrlrure 189 Commodity Import Policy The earlier mention of meat imports as a case where theory has definite predictions brings to mind the fact that it ain't quite so. One hears cattle interests argue that while free trade is in general a nice idea, steps to stabilize imports by restraining excessive foreign supplies of imported meat are necessary to insure a healthy U.S. cattle industry, and that unrestrained imports would drive U.S. cattlemen out of business, after which prices would be higher than ever. Thus, a theory is generated by which restraining imports increases the long-run well being of consumers as well as producers. Another similarly dubious theory was put forth by soybean interests and presented to Congress by an assistant secretary of agriculture under the Ford administration in 1976, when palm oil imports were seen as a threat to U.S. producers of vegetable oils. The theory is that if imported palm oil drives down the price of U.S. soybean oil, U.S. crushers will have to cover their margins by charging higher soybean meal prices. This will increase the price of meat, so that consumers will be made worse off. Therefore, the argument goes, the welfare of both consumers and producers is best served by restricting palm oil imports. The failure of analysis here is mainly a failure of will.

To assess the appropriateness of the peg during the current period of high oil export earnings and the likely consequences of a liberalization, this paper attempts to disentangle the effects of oil prices from other factors underlying the equilibrium real exchange rate, and examines the role of foreign exchange controls by extending the application of a vector error correction (VEC) model to parallel market exchange rates. Several findings are worth noting. First, oil prices have indeed played a significant role in determining a time-varying equilibrium real exchange rate path. Second, oil prices are not the only important determinant of the real effective exchange rate: declining productivity is also a key factor. Third, appreciation pressures are rising. Finally, the speed of convergence of a VEC model using parallel rather than official rates is higher, suggesting that the government has been able to maintain sharp deviations between the official and equilibrium rates because of Venezuela's oil dependency and the concentration of oil income in government hands.\nCollapse"}
